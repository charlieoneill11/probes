He likely suffers from tension headaches and pre-hypertension with associated dyslipidemia and prediabetes. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used as needed for headache relief. Treatment should focus on statin therapy, as the patient has not been on a statin before and the LDL is the most pressing issue. Increase fiber intake for dyslipidemia. Prescribe Atorvastatin 20 mg daily, standard dose for Australian guidelines. This will help lower his significantly elevated LDL-C (160 mg/dL) and reduce cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle modifications are crucial for managing his prediabetes and other risk factors, a moderate-dose statin is the most appropriate single medication to add at this stage due to the severity of his dyslipidemia and multiple risk factors. Therefore, prescribe Atorvastatin 20 mg daily.
