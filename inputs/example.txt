John Doe, a 54-year-old male, presents for a routine check-up with occasional headaches and fatigue persisting for three months. The headaches occur 2–3 times per week, are mild to moderate with a tight, band-like sensation in the frontal and temporal regions, worsening by end of the workday but relieved with rest and hydration. He denies nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, photophobia, phonophobia, or neurological deficits. Fatigue is described as a persistent lack of energy despite 7–8 hours of sleep per night, with no significant weight loss, night sweats, or depressive symptoms. His medical history includes hypertension (diagnosed three years ago), currently managed with Amlodipine 5 mg daily, though BP remains mildly elevated (148/92 mmHg). He has no known drug allergies, no history of cardiovascular events, diabetes, or kidney disease, and a family history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes (father) and hyperlipidemia (mother), increasing his cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle factors include a sedentary job, heavy alcohol intake (2–3 drinks per day), no smoking, and a high-sodium, processed diet, with a BMI of 28.7 (overweight). Physical exam is unremarkable, with neurological and cardiovascular exams normal. 

Laboratory investigations reveal dyslipidemia: total cholesterol 230 mg/dL (elevated), LDL-C 160 mg/dL (elevated), HDL-C 42 mg/dL (borderline low), triglycerides 180 mg/dL (mildly elevated). Liver and renal function tests are normal, and HbA1c is 5.6% (near prediabetic range). Given his elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, and high total cholesterol, he has not previously been on a statin but should commence atorvastatin 20 mg daily, in line with Australian guidelines. Contraindications to statin therapy, including active liver disease, persistent liver enzyme elevation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, renal impairment, history of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, CYP3A4 inhibitor use, heavy alcohol intake, and uncontrolled hypothyroidism, should be considered before initiation.
    
Answer:
The LDL-C was 160 which is elevated. The HDL-C was 42 which is borderline low where >40 is ideal for men. The total cholesterol was 230 which is elevated. This patient has dyslipidaemia. The patient should be on a statin. For the Australian context, atorvastatin is often first line. The patient has never been on a statin before. They should therefore start on 20mg daily of atorvastatin.
