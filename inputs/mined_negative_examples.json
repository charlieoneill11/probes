How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named \u201cThe Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain\u201d.\n\nMy Hero Academia- Funimation\n\nWe open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.\n\nMy Hero Academia- Funimation\n\nA tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It\u2019s Hosu\u2019s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper. Uncertified heroes using their Quirks against their instructors",
    "<bos>---\nabstract: |\n    We give a general construction of debiased/locally robust/orthogonal (LR) moment functions for GMM, where the derivative with respect to first step nonparametric estimation is zero and equivalently first step estimation has no effect on the influence function. This construction consists of adding an estimator of the influence function adjustment term for first step nonparametric estimation to identifying or original moment conditions. We also give numerical methods for estimating LR moment functions that do not require an explicit formula for the adjustment term.\n\n    LR moment conditions have reduced bias and so are important when the first step is machine learning. We derive LR moment conditions for dynamic discrete choice based on first step machine learning estimators of conditional choice probabilities.\n\n    We provide simple and general asymptotic theory for LR estimators based on sample splitting. This theory uses the additive decomposition of LR moment conditions into an identifying condition and a first step influence adjustment. Our conditions require only mean square consistency and a few (generally either one or two) readily interpretable rate conditions.\n\n    LR moment functions have the advantage of being less sensitive to first step estimation. Some LR moment functions are also doubly robust meaning they hold if one first step is incorrect. We give novel classes of doubly robust moment functions and characterize double robustness",
    "<bos>Tag Archive for interact\n\nQuestion by Jon: What is the best way to interact with or select job recruiters?\nI work primarily as a front end web developer and get calls from multiple recruitment firms. I do a fair bit of project work, so this is a recurring thing for me. Currently, if they have a position that I\u2019m a fit for I reflexively ask them to present me for that position. Is that an optimal strategy? If one company submits me, another cannot, so I want to be submitted by the best company. Should I therefore be taking steps to identify which recruiting firms are the most effective, give preference to local firms, find which firms ask the target employer for a smaller fee, select (somehow) for firms that have a better relationship with the target client, check out a firm\u2019s reputation online before submittal, etc. Or is all of that wasted work?\n\nI\u2019m looking for things that are efficient yet effective. Thanks for any tips!\nYes, I know I can work with several agencies for different jobs. However I CAN\u2019T work with several agencies for the SAME JOB. Not in California, in any case. Double submissions get thrown out, or else the second agency to submit is rejected.",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nAre all I2C sensors interoperable?\n\nI have a quadcopter flight controller (RTFQ Flip MWC) that supports I2C sensors for adding thing like a barometer, magnetometer, and GPS system. The officially supported sensor block (BMP180, HMC5883L on one board) is discontinued, as far as I can tell. \nI have found other I2C barometer and magnetometer sensors, (BMP280, LSM303) but I am not even sure if all I2C devices of the same type are interoperable. Do they all look the same (at least interface-wise) to the flight controller?\nI'm also new to I2C in general; the sensors I need come on two separate boards. Do I just stack the boards, directly connecting the I2C bus between each?\nThanks in advance,\nNeil\nEDIT:\nI was able to find the datasheets for the discontinued and proposed sensors:\n\nBMP180\nHMC5883L\nBMP280\nLSM303\n\nAll are compatible with the 3.3v output of the Flip MWC, which is good.",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nXML Schema for analysis in C#\n\nIs it possible to use a XML Schema to check against the contents of a XML file?\nFor instance, in ASP.NET web.config, can I create a schema to check that <customErrors mode = \"On\">? This will ultimately be used in a C# app, the C# app should take in the XML document and the XML Schema and check if the XML Document violates any of the \"rules\" listed in the XML schema, i.e. <customErrors mode = \"Off\">\nIs it possible to do the checking without any boundary to the structure of the XML file? i.e. the attribute <customErrors> can be within any part of the XML document and the schema will still work.\n\nA:\n\nPossible: Yes, in XML Schema 1.1 using assertions.\nPractical or recommended: No.\nXML Schema is intended to be used to validate the \"structure of the XML file,\" as you anticipate in your question.  You can skip much of that via xsd:any and then use assertions to express the sort of spot-checks that you describe via XPath expressions.  However, it'd be more natural to just apply XPath expressions directly",
    "<bos>Historical conceptualizations of depression\n===========================================\n\nThere is a long tradition in phenomenologlcal psychopathology that stresses basic bodily alterations as core features of depressive states. Thus, Wernicke used the term \"vital feelings\" to describe certain somatic symptoms occurring in affective psychoses.^[@ref1]^ Vital feelings refer to the close relationship of the body to the awareness of self. They determine the way we experience our body and the impression we assume our physical presence makes on other people. Vital feelings are somatic affects localized In different parts of the body. Whereas vital feelings constitute the bodily background of our normal experiences, they may move to the fore In a depressive mood. For example, depressed patients very often complain of a headache which is described not exactly as an ordinary pain, but more as an unbearable pressure \"like a band around the head.\" Other disturbed vital feelings affect the chest or the abdomen, and mediate unpleasant sensations of weight, tension, heaviness, or Inhibition, totally absorbing the focus of attention. In quite a similar way Dupr\u00e9 speaks of \"coenestopathic states\" which mean a distressing, qualitative change of normal physical feeling In certain areas of the body during an episode of depressive mood. It Is a global loss of vitality In which all bodily parts and functions",
    "<bos>Formulation and application of a biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus as collector in the flotation of oily water in industrial environment.\nThe present study describes the formulation of a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP1616 and investigates its long-term stability for application as a collector in a bench-scale dissolved air flotation (DAF) prototype. For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by",

    "<bos>INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is still a major global health problem, with an estimated 257 million people worldwide that are chronically infected with HBV ([@B1]). HBV, together with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and several other related animal viruses, belongs to the *Hepadnaviridae* family ([@B2]). The HBV virion is comprised of an outer envelope and an inner icosahedral nucleocapsid (NC) assembled by 240 copies of core protein (HBc) and packaged with a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded circular DNA genome ([@B3][@B4][@B8]). In addition to DNA-containing virions, a large amount of incomplete viral particles, such as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles, empty virions, and naked capsids, can also be released from cells in the process of virus replication ([@B9]). Subviral HBsAg particles are spherical or rodlike and are present in vast excess over virions in sera of CHB patients ([@B2]). Empty virions share the same structure as DNA-containing virions but are devoid of nucleic acids ([@B1",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nIs it focus or depth of field?\n\nI was trying to shoot a group of people standing clumped but at different distances, quite close to me, think disorganized portrait. I have a Nikon d750,  and was not able to get everyone into focus.  If I brought the people closer to me in focus, then the background were blurred and vice versa.  I pushed the aperture all the way to f18 or so and it didn't bring the whole scene into focus.  Was I shooting from too close ....  Or this makes me wonder is this about AF-S vs AF-A instead of aperture and the camera choosing one point to focus upon instead of the area?  How would you compose a group shot like this to all be in focus?  Thanks! \n\nA:\n\nIt sounds like depth of field.  If (with an APS crop sensor, 30 mm lens, f/4), if you focus at say 6 feet you might have about 2 feet of DOF span, like from 5 feet to 7 feet (coarse approximations).  If your subject is distributed at say 6 to 8 feet, this 5-7 DOF zone does not include",

    "<bos>Cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children: data from benign rolandic epilepsy.\nThe effects of antiepileptic drugs on cognition are difficult to delineate, yet of critical importance for children with epilepsy. We investigated the cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Ten subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy were evaluated with and without carbamazepine treatment. Fourteen unmedicated subjects with migraine headache evaluated twice served as a control group. Subjects were 6 to 12 years of age, fluent in English, and not mentally retarded. We found that children with benign rolandic epilepsy were quicker on a visual-search task and recalled stories better when not treated than when treated with carbamazepine. After correction for multiple comparisons only the memory finding remained significant. Higher carbamazepine serum level was associated with slower performance on the same visual-search task. This latter finding did not meet multiple comparison criteria. Numerous significant practice effects were found within the control group. Comparisons with reliable change indices identified two subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy with particularly poor scores while receiving carbamazepine. These findings suggest some effects on memory from carbamazepine; however, they do not support meaningful dosage-related effects, within the recommended range. Significant practice effects",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nbootstrap.min.css sets transparency where not wanted\n\nI have a small chatbox at the bottom of my page which seems to be inheriting CSS style from bootstrap.min.css and that chatbox is transparent which is a nuisance because the underlying text on the page shows through and what is worse, is that hyperlinks on the page are over-riding clickable areas in the chatbox for opening, closing and submitting messages.\nI have tried adding CSS style to the chatbox for opacity and rgba. Even tried adding a background image but to no effect.\nI have since modified the chatbox to display an iFrame from a different site that does not use bootstrap.min.css.\nBut even the iFrame page is affected by transparency. I can remove the transparency setting in bootstrap.min.css but that will not solve my bigger problem... I am intending to use this chatbox on several sites and may not have control of the site's CSS.\nSo I need a way to override the parent site's CSS just for the chatbox. \nIf that is impossible, then I can  weed out the transparency from bootstrap.min.css that is used on my own sites.

    "<bos>Confederaci\u00f3n Revolucionaria de Obreros y Campesinos\n\nThe Confederaci\u00f3n Revolucionaria de Obreros y Campesinos (CROC) is a Mexican trade union confederation. It is one of the most important and influential trade unions in the History of Mexico.\n\nIt was founded in April 1952. during a congress made by four workers centrals. Until 1980 the CROC had 750 000 workers inside the union, in only 17 of the 31 states and the Federal District (Mexico City); in this year the statements change in order to change the organization of the union by changing the presidency of the union, that was rotative and with only one year of duration to a presidency headed by a National Secretary General (Secretario General del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo Nacional).\n\nIt currently has 4.5 million worker members throughout the 32 states in the country having also 17 National Industrial Confederacies; also 3.600 unions with 15 000 collective contracts.\n\nExternal links \nHistory of the Confederaci\u00f3n Revolucionaria de Obreros y Campesinos (Campesinos an Workers Revolutionary Confederacy) \n\nCategory:National",

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\n\nA:\n\nwhy was he banned?\nI'm",
    "<bos>This invention relates generally to enzymes that convert sucrose to isomaltulose. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel sucrose isomerases, to polynucleotides encoding these enzymes, to methods for isolating such polynucleotides and to nucleic acid constructs that express these polynucleotides. The invention also relates to cells, particularly transformed bacterial or plant cells, and to differentiated plants comprising cells, which express these polynucleotides. The invention further relates to the use of the polypeptides, polynucleotides, cells and plants of the invention for producing isomaltulose.\nIsomaltulose \u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-1,6-D-fructofuranose (also called palatinose) is a naturally occurring structural isomer of sucrose (\u03b1-D-glucosyl-1,2-D-fructose). Isomaltulose is a nutritive disaccharide, with sweetness and bulk similar to sucrose. Several characteristics make isomaltulose advantageous over sucrose for some applications in the food industry: 1) noncariogenic (not causing dental decay); 2) low glycemic index (useful for diabetics); 3) selective promotion of growth of beneficial bifidobacteria among human intestinal microflora; 4) greater stability of",

My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.",
    "<bos>From the mid-1960's until the close of that decade, automobiles became lighter, more compact, and more powerful. Auto manufacturers continued to compete against one another for drag-strip supremacy. As government regulations and safety concerns increased, the muscle car era began to decline rapidly.\n\nMany of these ultimate high-performance muscle cars were built to satisfy homologation requirements. Others were built just to have the fastest machine on the road. The Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda is an example of one of the fiercest and most powerful vehicle ever constructed for the roadway. It was derived from the lesser Barracuda's which began in the mid-1960's. It was built atop the 'E' body platform and was restyled in 1970 by John Herlitz, making it longer, wider, and lower. The 426 cubic-inch Hemi V8 was capable of producing an astonishing 425 horsepower. Matted to a four-speed manual 833 transmission, this was the ultimate muscle car of its day.\n\nThis 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible with black paint and orange billboards was offered for sale at the 2006 RM Auction in",
    "<bos>Perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to visual recognition memory can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures based on conscious awareness of prior occurrence.\nThe ability of humans to distinguish consciously between new and previously encountered objects can be probed with visual recognition memory tasks that require explicit old-new discriminations. Medial temporal-lobe (MTL) lesions impair performance on such tasks. Within the MTL, both perirhinal cortex and the hippocampus have been implicated. Cognitive processes can also be affected by past object encounters in the absence of conscious recognition, as in repetition priming tasks. Past functional neuroimaging findings in healthy individuals suggest that even in tasks that require conscious recognition decisions for visual stimuli, posterior cortical structures in the ventral visual pathway distinguish between old and new objects at a nonconscious level. Conclusive evidence that differentiates the neural underpinnings of conscious from nonconscious processes in recognition memory, however, is still missing. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for the MTL have been inconsistent towards this end. In the present fMRI study, we tested whether perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to recognition memory can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures in the ventral visual pathway based on the participants' reported conscious awareness of prior occurrence.

    "<bos>Effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mutans to microfilled composite resin and giomer surfaces.\nSurface attributes of a restoration play an important role in adherence of plaque bacteria. Prophylaxis methods may be involved in modification of or damaging the restoration surface. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of two restorative materials. A total of 60 specimens were prepared from each material; a microfilled composite resin (HelioProgress) and a giomer (Beautifil II). For each material, the specimens were randomly divided into three groups (n=20). Group 1: no prophylaxis treatment (control); Group 2: prophylaxis with pumice and rubber cup; Group 3: prophylaxis with air-powder polishing device (APD). The surfaces of selected specimens from each group were evaluated under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the surface topography formed by the two prophylaxis methods was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of specimens was determined by the plate counting method following immersion in a bacterial innoculum for 4 hours, rinsing and sonication. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test",
    "<bos>One hundred years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasing health problem and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but knowledge about its pathogenesis has increased substantially in recent years. The disease results from interaction between individual risk factors (like enzymatic deficiencies) and environmental exposures to noxious agents, like cigarette smoking, occupational dusts, air pollution and infections in childhood. The main mechanisms that may contribute to airflow limitation in COPD are fixed narrowing of small airways, emphysema and luminal obstruction with mucus secretions. COPD is characterised by a chronic inflammatory process in the pulmonary tissue, with a pattern different from bronchial asthma, associated with extrapulmonary effects and is considered now a complex, systemic disease. Optimal therapeutic targeting of COPD depends on a clear understanding of the precise mechanisms of these complex processes and on early and correct evaluation of disease severity. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches is used to treat COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD treatment and can be combined with inhaled corticosteroids for greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The use of LTOT for hypoxemic patients has resulted in increased survival, and expanded drug therapy options have effectively improved dyspnoea and quality of life. Recent studies have",
    "<bos>Dietary sodium chloride intake independently predicts the degree of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in healthy humans consuming a net acid-producing diet.\nWe previously demonstrated that typical American net acid-producing diets predict a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the diet net acid load as indexed by the steady-state renal net acid excretion rate (NAE). We now investigate whether a sodium (Na) chloride (Cl) containing diet likewise associates with a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the sodium chloride content of the diet as indexed by the steady-state Na and Cl excretion rates. In the steady-state preintervention periods of our previously reported studies comprising 77 healthy subjects, we averaged in each subject three to six values of blood hydrogen ion concentration ([H]b), plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO(3)(-)]p), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)), the urinary excretion rates of Na, Cl, NAE, and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CrCl), and performed multivariate analyses. Dietary Cl strongly correlated positively with dietary Na (P < 0.001) and was an independent negative predictor of [HCO(3)(-)]p after adjustment for diet net acid load, Pco(2) and",

However, it is unknown in the lateral decubitus position. We thus compared forced-air warming on the upper and lower bodies in the lateral position. Patients (n=123) were randomised to receive forced-air warming on the upper body or lower body during thoracoscopic surgery in the lateral position. We measured the nasopharyngeal temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after lateral positioning during surgery and the infrared tympanic membrane temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after surgery. Patients received both upper and lower body warming at a temperature of <35.5\u00b0C. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia with a temperature of <36.0\u00b0C. Intraoperative hypothermia was less frequent with the upper body warming than with the lower body warming {",

    "<bos>[A meningioma in the posterior fossa without dural attachment: case report].\nAn extremely rare case of a meningioma in the posterior fossa without dural attachment has been reported. The patient was a 56-year-old male whose chief manifestation was the abnormality of his CT scan. His past history included gastric and colonic polyp when he was 54, 55 years old, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before hospitalization in our department. CT scan showed a small round non-enhancing lesion located at the lateral site of the right cerebellar cortex. T1 weighted image of MRI showed a homogeneous low intensity lesion with partial enhancing with Gd-DTPA. Proton image showed a remarkable low intensity lesion which showed an extramedullary mass. Right retromastoid craniectomy was performed. The mass was an extramedullary tumor which had no relation with the cerebellar cortex and dura matter. The arachnoid membrane around the tumor was intact. The tumor was totally resected and the patient had no neurological deficits. Histopathologically, the tumor was delineated into laminar structures by collagen fiber. Tumor cells were spindle in shape and made a whorling formation. There was no psammoma body and it had a hyperchromatic nuclei without mitotic",

At that point, I decided to try and do the menu with a simpler css/html/jquery approach but I've hit a jam.\nI have the following method in my datalayer that gets information for the menu and returns it as XML.

    "<bos>The bantamweight champion of DEEP, Takafumi Otsuka, will take on Koichi Ishiuzka on May 13th at Differ Ariake in Tokyo.\n\nOtsuka was supposed to fight Fernando Vieira for the WSOF-GC bantamweight title in December. However, the Brazilian was over the weight at the first weigh-in and never showed up at the second weigh-in. Vieira was nowhere to be found after this.The Brazilian basically fled from the entire show.\n\nOtsuka became the inaugural WSOF-GC champ but this means, the last time he fought was back in August of last year. That was, however, against a Mongolian fighter named Baataryn Azjavkhlan who was 1-0 at the time.\n\nIn terms of competitive fight, vs Daisuke Engo in February 2016 maybe is the last time Otsuka went through, which is more than a year ago.\n\nIshizuka is basically born and raised in DEEP.\n\nAnd, he is undefeated in the last ten fights.\n\nFor Ishizuka, this must be the opportunity he has been looking for all of his pro MMA career.\n\nSo, Ishizuka has to be motivated than ever.",

I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > \"ROM\").\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nObject Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.\n\nObject/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]\n\nYour query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel.

It has been recently reported that a transcription factor, Twist, plays a pivotal role in metastasis of breast tumors by inducing EMT. In this study, we examined whether Twist relates to renal fibrogenesis including EMT of tubular epithelia, evaluating Twist expression level in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. Kidneys of mice subjected to UUO were harvested 1, 3, 7, and 10 days after obstruction. Compared with control kidneys, Twist mRNA-level significantly increased 3 days after UUO (UUO day 3 kidney) and further augmented until 10 days after UUO. Twist expression increased in tubular epithelia of the dilated tubules and the expanded interstitial areas of UUO kidneys, where cell-proliferating appearances were frequently found in a time-dependent manner. Although a part of tubular cells in whole nephron segment were immunopositive for Twist in UUO day 7 kidneys, tubular epithelia downstream of nephron more frequently expressed Twist than upstream of nephron. In UUO day 7 kidneys, some tubular epithelia were",

Twenty-three adults with hearing loss were separated into 2 groups. Thirteen subjects (6 men, 7 women, mean age, 25.7 +/- 3.9 years) constituted the intervention group, whereas 10 subjects (5 men, 5 women, mean age, 26.4 +/- 5.9 years) formed the control group. Pretraining and posttraining treadmill tests were performed to determine heart rate (HR peak), peak minute ventilation (VE peak), peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak, absolute and relative), and time to exhaustion (min). Peak torque of hamstring and quadriceps muscles at angular velocities of 60 degrees /s, 180 degrees /s, and 300 degrees /s was also measured. The intervention group followed a 12-week traditional dance training program, whereas the control group received no training during this period. Repeated measures of multiple analyses of variance were used to test mean differences between the values of both groups. A paired t",

Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\n\nConcept\n\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\n\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\n\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\n\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be",

The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations have not been fully characterized, therefore a previous analysis of NS5A-SH3 domain interactions was extended. By using a semi-quantitative ELISA assay, a hierarchy of binding between various SH3 domains for NS5A was demonstrated. Molecular modelling of a polyproline motif within NS5A (termed PP2.2) bound to the FynSH3 domain predicted that the specificity-determining RT-loop region within the SH3 domain did not interact directly with the PP2.2 motif. However, it was demonstrated that the RT loop did contribute to the specificity of binding, implicating the involvement of other intermolecular contacts between NS5A and SH3 domains. The modelling analysis also predicted a critical role for a conserved arginine located at the C terminus of the PP2.2 motif; this was confirmed experimentally. Finally, it was demonstrated that, in comparison with wild-type replicon cells",

    "<bos>POV: Henry vs Martin + a poll\n\nI won\u2019t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H & M do resemble me in various ways :)\n\nI usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the",

General benefits of using Hitec Power Protection rotary UPS systems are:\n\nMost reliable systemThe simple design has fewer components than for example static UPS systems. This highly improves the reliability (MTBF). Our systems have a lifetime expectancy of more than 25 years.\n\nMost cost and energy efficient systemOperating efficiency of our systems can exceed 97%, because they do not require power conversion in the power path or a conditioned, energy consuming battery room during operation. You also do not need battery replacement every 3 to 5 years, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to for example static UPS technologies.\n\nMost environmental friendly systemOur rotary systems have high energy efficiency and do not use batteries. Static UPS systems for example produce a considerable amount of chemical waste during its lifetime, because batteries need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years. Click here to find out more about the environmental benefits of our systems.\n\nMost space efficient systemA static UPS system requires a diesel generator set, power electronics, batteries and numerous auxiliary equipment.

Both Mariandynians and Bebrycians lived in northwestern Asia Minor.\n Dymas, a soldier who fought on the side of the Seven Against Thebes. He took part in the foot-race at Opheltes' funeral games in Nemea. Dymas was wounded in battle and killed himself when the enemy started questioning him.\n Dymas, a Dorian and the ancestor of the Dymanes. His father, Aegimius, adopted Heracles' son, Hyllas. Dymas and his brother, Pamphylus, submitted to Hyllas.\n Dymas, king of Phrygia and father of Hecuba.\n Dymas, perhaps the same as the first. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus this Dymas was the father of Meges, a Trojan whose sons fought at Troy.\n Dymas, an Aulian warrior, who came to fight at Troy under the leadership of Archesilaus.

    "<bos>Soluble di- and aminopeptidases in Escherichia K-12. Dispensible enzymes.\nAs part of a study of the peptidase content of Escherichia coli K-12, two peptidase-deficient amino acid auxotrophs isolated and characterized by Miller as pepD- (strain CM17) and pepD- pepN- pepA- pepB- pepQ- (strain CM89) were examined for the presence of several peptidases previously obtained from strain K-12 in this laboratory. The soluble fraction of each mutant was found to lack the broad-specificity strain K-12 dipeptidase DP and the strain CM89 fraction also lacked activity characteristic of the strain K-12 aminopeptidases AP, L, and OP; like strain CM17, strain CM89 contained the tripeptide-specific aminopeptidase TP. Strain CM89 (but not CM17) appeared to contain little if any activity attributable to the ribosome-bound aminopeptidase I of strain K-12. Whereas loss of DP, AP, OP, and aminopeptidase I activity may be attributed to the pepD-, pepB-, pepN-, and pepA- mutations, respectively",

Fifty-three patients with head injury were divided into 3 groups; Group A patients with mild head injury; Group B with moderate head injury; and Group C with severe head injury. The serum levels of CD62p, CD63 were measured on 12 h, d 1, 3, 5 and 7 after injury. The serum levels of CD62p and CD63 in Group B and Group C were higher than those in Group A and control (P<0.05). The serum level of CD62p in Group C was higher than that in Group B (P<0.05). The serum levels of CD62p in Group C on d 1, 3, 5 after injury were higher than those on 12 h (P<0.05).

    "<bos>Q:\n\nWhere to get flight dynamics for a flight sim model?\n\nOnce, a while ago, I tried to create a Flight Simulator X model for an aircraft that I wanted a model of, but was soon overwhelmed by having to guess so much of the flight dynamics. Is there somewhere where I could get detailed information about the flight dynamics of aircraft without contacting the manufacturer, a pilot, or having the plane itself to run tests on? I mean for things like drag at different mach, drag coefficient created by the landing gear, lift coefficient created by the flaps, detailed stuff about the engines, etc.\n\nA:\n\nUnfortunately I have no experience with how FSX models aircraft, but at a guess, it's model requires extensive experimental data from a real aircraft to truly get the right parameters.\nAnd that's something no hobbyist is likely to be able to do. For that matter, it's pretty difficult for a pilot to do, since actually recording the relevant data is difficult, and some of what you need to know requires doing things with the aircraft you probably shouldn't do in most circumstances.\nX-Plane's flight model and aircraft creation tool is far more forgiving. You still end up having to guess a lot of parameters,",

    "<bos>Expression of four growth factors in recessed extraocular muscles of rabbits.\nThe study was designed to determine the temporal expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, basic fibroblast factor 2 (bFGF-2), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in recessed extraocular muscles. Sixteen eyes of eight rabbits were subjected to conventional 4-mm recession of superior rectus muscles. Two rabbits were untreated as control. The rabbits were killed and their eyes were enucleated at 3 (group 3), 6 (group 6), 24 (group 24), and 72 (group 72) hours after the operation (two rabbits per group), and the expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, bFGF-2, and TGF-beta1 was immunohistochemically examined.

The upgrades here are where it matters most - a 20 crit increase over t6 (more than 1 % - thats fantastic in a single piece!) and plus 9",
    "<bos>My new global trends book is out now: The Future of Almost Everything. But it takes at least 20 years to evaluate how good a trends analyst was / is \u2013 so what about forecasts made by me in previous books, about what to expect over the following decade or two or three? How did those forecasts measure up? I had to answer that question for myself by re-reading what I wrote in the past about the future, before writing my latest book. Read FREE SAMPLE of The Truth about Almost Everything.\n\nSo you can judge for yourself, here are loads of predictions I made in the past - and the book in which they were made plus date. Every one of these is already a reality or looks like it soon could be, as of August 2015....And yes I got some things wrong - not many fortunately. I am going to publish the entire text of Futurewise 1998 edition on this website for a complete picture - but of course on this site already are hundreds of posts and videos going back in some cases over 20 years.\n\nHere's one I got wrong: I thought video streaming would take off - but with more use of live video using smartphones that we have actually seen.

    "<bos>Divesting Of Kruger\u2019s Cash (Updated)\n\nFreshman Sen. David Carlucci, one of 17 Senate Democrats who received campaign contributions from Sen. Carl Kruger during the 2010 election cycle, is getting rid of that money after learning of the federal corruption charges lodged against his colleague earlier today.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that these types of allegations have clouded the legislature, tainting the hard working men and women who work diligently and honorably to serve their constituents,\u201d Carlucci said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI ran on a platform of ethics reform and these unsavory allegations are just another example of why ethics reform in Albany needs to be addressed immediately. The people of New York deserve better. In light of these allegations, I will be donating the $5,000 given to me during my campaign from Senator Kruger to a charitable organization in my district.\u201d\n\nAll told, Kruger, a prodigious fundraiser who had close to $1.9 million in his campaign committee, \u201cFriends of Carl,\u201d as of Jan. 15, doled out $49,000 to fellow senators this cycle, according to campaign finance records on file at the state Board of Elections.

    "<bos>When Rudy Gay left the game with a left knee injury late in the first quarter, memories of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 (16-22) recent poor play minus a star resurfaced. The thought came to fruition as DeMarcus Cousins joined him on the sidelines in the waning seconds of regulation, and the short-handed Kings fell to the visiting Dallas Mavericks (27-12), 108-104.\n\nThe Kings are currently 2-2 on their six-game home stand and return to action on Friday in a contest against the Miami Heat.

Can the Kings win without DeMarcus Cousins?\n\nThe Kings are 0-7 without their starting center and it looks like Cousins will miss another game on Wednesday with a strained left hip flexor. Andrew Bogut is questionable for the Warrior with left shoulder inflammation, as is reserve Jermaine O\u2019Neal (sore back). This game might turn into a track meet, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Sacramento.\n\n2. Can the Kings defend the 3-",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nHP MSA70 / P800 Array Failure - Shows 2 drives in each slot, 13/25 drives \"missing\"\n\nWe have an HP MSA70 with 25 x 600GB HP SAS 10k DP drives, connected to an HP P800 controller.  The drives are configured in RAID 6.  \nYesterday, some kind of unknown \"event\" occurred and the array dropped offline.  We rebooted the server (running CENTOS 6.2) and upon startup, the Array Controller reported that 13 of the drives are \"missing\".  When we look at the volume in the Array management, there are two entries for each slot for slots 1-12.  One shows a 600gb drive and one shows a 0gb drive.  There are no more entries after 12.\nWe contacted HP support, who sent us to Tier 2 support, and after many hours gave up.  They said they have never seen this, before (my favorite thing to hear from a vendor).\nHas anybody seen this before, and have we lost all of the data?\nThank you.\n\nA:\n\n",

She was the daughter of a blacksmith, Gilboe started her career in musical theatre and operas in Aarhus before she moved to Copenhagen to work at different theatres. Her national breakthrough came, when she  accepted the role as Eliza in My Fair Lady at Falkoner Teatret at short notice in 1960. Although she was then in her mid-40s and had only five days to learn the part, the production was a huge success.\n\nIn the following years she took on more and more non-singing roles, and besides her theatre career she took a degree in rhetoric. Later in her life she started teaching rhetoric and drama. She appeared in several films, receiving particular acclaim for her appearance as Esther in Carlo & Esther, a 1994 film. She plays a woman in her 70s who catches the attention of Carlo who has a wife with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "<bos>Update: Sree Narasimha Jayanthi \u2013 May 17th 2019\n\nThis day signifies the appearance of Lord Narasimha on the planet. Lord Narasimha is the fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is believed to have appeared to protect his devotee, Prahlada, from his father Hiranyakashyapu .\n\nIf you listen to the song \u201d Narashima Nembo davana\u201d posted on youtube, there is a paragraph which explains how Lord Narashima came from the pillar. Hiranyakashyapu pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Lord Vishnu was present in it pillar. Prahalada who was a great devotee said yes. Next, you know Hiranyakashyapu uses his Gadha and broke open the pillar and there emerged our Lord Narasimha who than slained Hiranyakashyapu using his sharp paws.\n\nThe day signifies the triumph of good over evil and the eagerness of the lord to protect his devotees from evil.\n\nWhen my Parents visited us last year, my Father recited the \u201cBhagavatha Purana\u201d for three weeks at my place. The way my Dad explained this part of the Purana, brings tears to my eyes",
    "<bos>Enhanced absorption and inhibited metabolism of emodin by 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside: Possible mechanisms for Polygoni Multiflori Radix-induced liver injury.\nPolygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) has been commonly used as a tonic in China for centuries. However, PMR-associated hepatotoxicity is becoming a safety issue. In our previous in vivo study, an interaction between stilbenes and anthraquinones has been discovered and a hypothesis is proposed that the interaction between stilbene glucoside-enriching fraction and emodin may contribute to the side effects of PMR. To further support our previous in vivo results in rats, the present in vitro study was designed to evaluate the effects of 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (TSG) on the cellular absorption and human liver microsome metabolism of emodin. The obtained results indicated that the absorption of emodin in Caco-2 cells was enhanced and the metabolism of emodin in human liver microsomes was inhibited after TSG treatment. The",
    "<bos>Perinatal outcome with the modified biophysical profile.\nOur purpose was to evaluate perinatal outcomes in high-risk pregnancies monitored with a modified biophysical profile. All non-insulin-dependent patients referred for antepartum fetal surveillance received a modified biophysical profile biweekly. A modified biophysical profile is a combination of a nonstress test and an amniotic fluid index. Patients with a singleton gestation and intact membranes were entered into a protocol of randomized backup testing for an abnormal modified biophysical profile. Those patients having a nonreactive fetal heart rate, significant variable decelerations, late decelerations, or an amniotic fluid index < or = 5.0 cm received either a contraction stress test or a biophysical profile immediately. Once randomized, a patient received the same backup test, when indicated, with subsequent testing. A total of 2774 patients had 17,429 tests with an uncorrected perinatal mortality rate of 2.9 per 1000. The overall incidence of an adverse perinatal outcome (i.e., perinatal death or nursery death before infant hospital discharge, cesarean delivery for fetal distress within the first 2 hours of labor, 5-minute Apgar score < 7, neonatal seizures",
    "<bos>Conventional methods for producing metal powder include a water atomizing method, which provides metal powder by injecting a high pressure water jet to a flow of a molten material; a gas atomizing method, which employs spraying of N2 gas or Ar gas in place of the water jet used in the atomizing method; and a centrifugation method, in which a molten material jet is injected into cooling water present in a rotary drum rotating at high speed. Fine particles are also produced through a breakdown method such as mechanical formation employing a mill or the like and also through a buildup method such as a precipitation method or a sol-gel method.\nHowever, in the water atomizing method and the gas atomizing method, the nozzle structure is complicated and an excessive load is imposed on nozzles, resulting in lowered durability of the nozzle, since the molten material is formed into powder form by a flow of high pressure cooling water or cooling gas. Meanwhile, in the centrifugation method, the structure of the apparatus is complicated, in order to enable high-speed rotation of the rotary drum. Furthermore, in these methods, the molten metal is pulverized on the basis of collision energy. Thus, the resulting particle size is varied, and the yield of fine particles is poor. The breakdown method employing mechanical formation or",
    "<bos>It is a truism that modern cell phones feature a multitude of features that expand on the traditional cell phone functionality. For example, today cell phone users are able to use their phones to connect to the Internet, manage meetings, appointments, and other aspects of their every day lives, listen to music and watch videos, etc. In essence the cell phone\u2014which began as a single-function communicator\u2014has grown into a fully functioning multimedia device. However the fundamental function of a cell phone remains communication. It should be noted that cell phones are also sometimes referred to as mobile phones, which in the proper meaning of the word indicates that the user of that phone is mobile, and is supposedly always available for anyone who might want to contact him or her.\nThe core functionality of mobile/cell phones has been basically the same since the first devices were made available to consumers. Although there has been a rapid expansion in the feature set of most cell phones, the core functionality has not seen a similar expansion. The reasons for the development discrepancy likely have to do with the fact that the core functionality is sufficient for most users and that there are not just that many ways of enhancing the person-to-person communication experience on a mobile device\nArguably, the most important enhancement in the",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nHow to create a django User using DRF's ModelSerializer\n\nIn django, creating a User has a different and unique flow from the usual Model instance creation. You need to call create_user() which is a method of BaseUserManager.\nSince django REST framework's flow is to do restore_object() and then save_object(), it's not possible to simply create Users using a ModelSerializer in a generic create API endpoint, without hacking you way through.\nWhat would be a clean way to solve this? or at least get it working using django's built-in piping?\nEdit:\nImportant to note that what's specifically not working is that once you try to authenticate the created user instance using django.contrib.auth.authenticate it fails if the instance was simply created using User.objects.create() and not .create_user().\n\nA:\n\nEventually I've overridden the serializer's restore_object method and made sure that the password being sent is then processes using instance.set_password(password), like so:\ndef restore_object(self, attrs, instance=None):\n    if not instance:\n        instance = super(RegisterationSerializer, self).restore_object",
    "<bos>Eochrysis, a new replacement name for the fossil Protochrysis Bischoff, 1916 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Chrysididae) nec Pascher, 1911 (Protista: Cryptomonada).\nThe genus Protochrysis (type species P. succinalis Bischoff, 1916, by monotypy) was established by Bischoff (1916: 139) for distinctive fossil insect remains of Eocene (Lutetian) age from the former K\u00f6nigsberg outskirts of East Prussia (now Kalinigrad, Russian Federation), referred at present to the Chrysididae (Hymenoptera) (Brues 1933; Carpenter 1985, 1992). However, an identical generic name Protochrysis had previously been proposed by Pascher (1911: 191) for a living protist (Cryptomonada). Bischoff's (1916) name is therefore an invalid junior homonym. Carpenter (1985: 577) proposed a new replacement name for the fossil genus, but overlooked the fact that his newly proposed generic name Protochrysidis was also preoccupied, again",

Ayrton Senna, before the San Marino Grand Prix, during which he suffered a fatal crash.\n\nOne of my best friends has been killed on the curve where I escaped death. I was lucky; he wasn't. It's like having a cheque book. You start pulling out the pages until one day no pages are left. He was the one driver so perfect nobody thought anything could happen to him.

    "<bos>Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\n\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018difference\u2019: is women\u2019s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\n\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From \u2018Protection\u2019 to \u2018Equality\u2019 (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to \u2018Provision for \u201cMenstrual Leave\u201d\u2019.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour.

    "<bos>Araucaria clonal forestry: types of cuttings and mother tree sex in field survival and growth\n\nResumo:\n\nAraucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paran\u00e1 pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by",

The mutations described are Gly-12----Arg, Gly-12----Val, Gln-61----His, Gln-61----Leu, which are all oncogenic, and the effector region mutant Asp-38----Glu. The resolutions of the crystal structures range from 2.0 to 2.6 A. Cellular and mutant p21 proteins are almost identical, and the only significant differences are seen in loop L4 and in the vicinity of the gamma-phosphate. For the Gly-12 mutants the larger side chains interfere with GTP binding and/or hydrolysis. Gln-61 in cellular p21 adopts a conformation where it is able to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. This conformation has not been found for the mutants of Gln-61. Furthermore, Leu-61 cannot activate the nucleophilic water because of the chemical nature of its side chain. The D38E mutation preserves its ability to",
    "<bos>1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to particularly an optical coherence tomography apparatus including an interference optical system which is used in the medical field, an optical coherence tomography method, an ophthalmic apparatus, a method of controlling the ophthalmic apparatus, and a storage medium.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nCurrently, various types of ophthalmic apparatuses using optical devices are used. Such apparatuses include, for example, an anterior ocular segment imaging apparatus, a fundus camera, and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Among them all, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) apparatus (to be referred to as an \u201cOCT apparatus\u201d hereinafter) is an apparatus capable of obtaining a high-resolution tomogram of an object to be examined. This OCT apparatus has been becoming an indispensable apparatus for dedicated retinal outpatient clinics.\nFor example, the OCT apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-325849 uses low-coherent light as a light source. Light from the light source is split into measurement light and reference light through a splitting optical path such as a beam splitter. Measurement light is light to irradiate an object to be examined such as the eye through a measurement light path. Return light of",
    "<bos>Moss (Physcomitrella patens) GH3 proteins act in auxin homeostasis.\nAuxins are hormones involved in many cellular, physiological and developmental processes in seed plants and in mosses such as Physcomitrella patens. Control of auxin levels is achieved in higher plants via synthesis of auxin conjugates by members of the GH3 family. The role of the two GH3-like proteins from P. patens for growth and auxin homeostasis was therefore analysed. The in vivo-function of the two P. patens GH3 genes was investigated using single and double knockout mutants. The two P. patens GH3 proteins were also heterologously expressed to determine their enzymatic activity. Both P. patens GH3 enzymes accepted the auxin indole acetic acid (IAA) as substrate, but with different preferences for the amino acid to which it is attached. Cytoplasmic localization was shown for PpGH3-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Targeted knock-out of either gene exhibited an increased sensitivity to auxin, resulting in growth inhibition. On plain mineral media mutants had higher levels of free IAA and less conjugated IAA than the wild type, and this effect was enhanced when auxin was supplied. The DeltaPpGH3-",
    "<bos>This invention relates to a method for applying normally dry relatively large particle size (granular) fertilizers to crops, such as lawns. Lawn fertilizers are available in various forms including solutions of nutrients in water, dispersions (suspensions) of fine powders (70-80 mesh and smaller) in an aqueous medium, dry powders and dry granules. In some cases, the nutrient materials are supported on an inert carrier, e.g. sand or clay.\nBoth liquid fertilizers and dispersions of fine powders in aqueous mediums are usually spray applied using conventional types of liquid solution fertilizer spraying equipment. A typical example of a spray applied dispersion of a powdered fertilizer material is illustrated by the U.S. Pat. No. to Funk 4,036,627. This patent discloses a high analysis fertilizer formulaton of low bulk density powdered ureaformaldehyde having soluble and insoluble portions combined with soluble monopotassium phosphate in which the resultant mixture is a dry homogeneous blend, free of fillers and binding agents, and which may be carried in a liquid medium for application to surface or subsurface areas by conventional liquid solution fertilizer applying equipment. The suspension generally has a fairly high concentration of the fine powder particles in the liquid medium.\nDry fertilizers in the powder form or",
    "<bos>Prevalence of varicocoele and its association with body mass index among 39,559 rural men in eastern China: a population-based cross-sectional study.\nVaricocoele is a common cause of male infertility. We undertook a population-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of varicocoele among rural men in eastern China and its association with body mass index. A total of 39,559 rural men in six counties in Beijing, Guangdong and Shandong provinces were recruited from 2011 to 2012. The presence and severity of varicocoele were measured by physical examinations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between varicocoele and body mass index after adjusting for possible confounders. Varicocoele was diagnosed in 1911 of 39,559 participants with an overall prevalence of 4.83%. The prevalence of varicocoele was highest in underweight (6.29%) and lowest in obese patients (3.71%, p < 0.05). The prevalence also decreased as body mass index increased in all three varicocoele grades. In multivariate logistic regression analysis",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nIs a low number of members in a class considered a code smell?\n\nI am currently making a simple to-do list program using the MVC pattern, and thus have a model class for the Notebook. However, something feels \"off\" as it has a very low number of members.\nThe Notebook is composed of categories, which are composed of To-do lists, which are composed of Items. \nWhat I cannot place is whether this is a case poor analysis (e.g. there are more members and responsibilities I am just missing them..) or perhaps a code smell that the class is not needed (in that case I'm not sure what to do as I could just have a list of categories in that controller, but then I don't have a notebook entity modelled which seems wrong as well).\nBelow is the very simple class I have:\nclass Notebook\n{\n    private String title;\n    private List<Category> categories;\n\n    public Notebook(String title, List<Category> categories)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public void setCategories(List<Category> categories)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public List<Category> getCategories()\n    {\n    }\n",

    "<bos>Social deprivation and primary hyperparathyroidism.\nTo investigate the potential relationship between social status or deprivation and the prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We retrospectively identified a cohort of patients diagnosed as having PHPT between 1981 and 2007 from the Scottish Morbidity Records database. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2006 quintiles were derived for these patients by using the postal codes. The distribution of the SIMD quintiles was examined to determine the possible influence of deprivation on the incidence of PHPT. In Scotland between 1981 and 2007, 3,039 patients were diagnosed as having PHPT, in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases code for PHPT. The distribution of the PHPT cohort across the SIMD 2006 quintiles was significantly different from that expected, with a higher representation (27.2%) among the most deprived and a lower representation (14.5%) in the least deprived quintile, in comparison with the 20% expected in each quintile (P<.0001). The findings in this study suggest that socioeconomic deprivation is associated with an increased risk of",
    "<bos>1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to multi-chamber process equipments for fabricating semiconductor devices.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nIn recent years, the advance in device miniaturization and IC complexity is increasing the need for more accurate and more complicated processes, and wafers of larger diameters. Accordingly, much attention is focused on multi-chamber process equipments (or systems) in view of increase of complex precesses, and enhancement of throughput in an individual wafer processing system.\nFIG. 14 shows one conventional example. A multi-chamber process equipment of this example includes a wafer transfer chamber 1, a plurality of process chambers 3 connected with the transfer chamber 1 through respective gate valves 2, a load lock chamber (preliminary evacuation chamber) 5 connected with the transfer chamber 1 through a gate valve 4, and a wafer load chamber 7 connected with the load lock chamber 5 through a gate valve 6.\nIn the wafer transfer chamber 1 and the load lock chamber 5, there are provided wafer transfer arms 9 and 10 for carrying a wafer 8, as shown in FIG. 14. The transfer arm 10 is designed to take each wafer ",
    "<bos>In general, absorbent articles should comfortably fit the body of a wearer. Most absorbent articles include an absorbent pad formed by an absorbent core contained in a wrap comprising a barrier tissue and/or a forming tissue. The subject invention discloses an absorbent article generally having extensibility in at least one direction, preferably the cross-direction. Such extensibility permits an absorbent article to extend and expand about the wearer and thus to better conform to the body of the wearer. Such extension and expansion about the wearer is feasible because both the bodyside liner and the outer cover are extensible in at least the one direction.\nIn conventional structures, the outer cover is typically adhesively secured to the forming tissue of the absorbent pad. In such embodiments, extending the outer cover in the cross-direction extends the forming tissue in the cross-direction. The force used to extend the outer cover, and thence the absorbent pad, can tear or otherwise damage the forming tissue or the barrier tissue of the absorbent pad. Since the absorbent pad is typically a sealed enclosure, namely an absorbent core enclosed within the combination of a forming tissue and a barrier tissue, tearing the absorbent pad, namely either the forming tissue or the barrier tissue, can release superabsorbent particles and other absorbent materials, such as cellulose fluff into contact with",

He\u2019s still pursuing appeals, which no one expects to go anywhere.\n\nGreene is a maximum security prison, classified as a \u201cSupermax\u201c, which contains a Death Row. Lifers there include Philadelphia serial killer Juan Covington, and three convicts await execution. This is one tough place.\n\n\u201cWe make individual decisions based on facts,\u201d Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said in a written statement. \u201cGiven the high-profile nature of this individual, coupled with the nature of his crimes, this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting.\u201d\n\nNoooo kidding, John!\n\n(We all know from watching TV crime dramas what happens to guys like Jer in da Big House.)\n\nJust how effective will the security measures be?

And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\n\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED",

As for sexual violence, there are scenes (In parts 3 and 4) which are detailed and graphic, and may not suite some readers.\n\nLord Conqueror of the Realm\n\nWritten by WarriorJudge\n\nPart 19\n\nIn northern Greece , in the tavern on the border between Philippi and Macedonia , Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton met with Domitia, in a room they had rented. The two Noblemen could not afford being overheard or even being seen in public with the lass.\n\n\"I don't understand. What did you do wrong?\" the frustrated Nobleman Marton shouted at poor Domitia, who of no fault of her own found herself in this impossible and dangerous position. It was all Nobleman Marton could do not to resort to physical violence.\n\n\"I did exactly as I'd been told\u2026\" the young woman tried to defend herself.\n\nNobleman Verosus sent his fist through the wall. \"Then the Conqueror should have been all over you\u2026 in and out of you!\" he yelled and his eyebrows nearly touched together",
    "<bos>Those words (choice profanity included) woke me with a start the other night. What was I thinking, organizing this trip to Vietnam to connect sons and daughters who lost fathers on both sides of the Vietnam War?\n\nI have a lot of fears about this journey. There\u2019s the mundane ones about getting sick, or bitten by something slimy. Maybe I'll become separated from the group because something in a shop caught my eye (this, given my nature, is the most likely scenario). But the deeper fears are right under the surface. What\u2019s going to happen when we come face to face with the Vietnamese sons and daughters? Will they be angry? Worse, will I?\n\nIt was easy to push past these bigger fears earlier this year when I first formed the 2 Sides Project. Now the trip is getting closer\u2014we leave four weeks from today\u2014and they\u2019re keeping me up at night.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to remember what I know in the daylight: there have been moments in my life when I\u2019ve found people who shared my experience, who spoke the same language as me, who felt the same way I did about things.

    "<bos>Introduction {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nInfliximab (IFX), a chimeric anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in a considerable proportion of IBD patients refractory to any other treatments \\[[@ref1],[@ref2]\\]. However, 8-12% of adult and/or pediatric patients fail to respond to the induction regimen (known as primary non responders) and approximately 40% of patients who respond initially and achieve clinical remission inevitably lose response over time\\[[@ref3],[@ref7]\\]. Lack of response to IFX is a stable trait and suggests that the differences in response might be in part genetically determined. Considering the high cost and safety profile of this drug, genetic targeting of patients responding to this therapy is certainly of great interest \\[[@ref8]\\]. So far, limited candidate gene association studies with response to IFX have been reported \\[[@ref9]-[@ref11]\\]. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in paediatric IBD patients has revealed that the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci were associated with primary non response \\[[@ref12]\\].

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to the reporting of Power Headroom (PH) from a User Equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system that supports carrier aggregation.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nMobile communication systems were originally designed to provide users with voice communication services while they are on the move. Current mobile communication systems are capable of supporting both voice communication services and data communication services for mobile users.\nStandardization for a next generation of mobile communication technology for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is being conducted for Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is a broadband packet-based communication technology that is expected to provide download speeds that improve upon existing data transmission rates by up to 100 Megabytes/second (Mbps). In attempting to achieve such a high data rate, studies have been conducted that use a minimum number of nodes in connection with a simplified network topology, and that place a radio protocol as close as possible to radio channels.\nFIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an LTE wireless communication system. The LTE wireless communication system includes a plurality of Evolved Node Bs (ENBs) 105, 110, 1",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nIs the sum of separating vectors always separating?\n\nIf $\\mathcal{R}$ is a von Neumann algebra acting on Hilbert space $H$ and $v, w \\in H$ are separating vectors for $\\mathcal{R}$, must $v+w$ be (either zero or) separating for $\\mathcal{R}$?\n[I have edited to remove the restriction to type III factors and am moving my proposed partial solution to an answer below.]\n\nA:\n\nNo, there must be a counterexample, under the mild assumption that there exists a nontrivial unitary $U \\in \\mathcal{R}$ whose restriction to the range of some nonzero projection $P \\in \\mathcal{R}$ is trivial (i.e. the identity).\nFix such a $U$ and $P$. Let $v$ be any separating vector for $\\mathcal{R}$ and let $w = -Uv$. This $w$ is separating for $\\mathcal{R}$ since any nonzero $T \\in \\mathcal{R}$ that annihilated $w$ would make $-TU$ a nonzero operator in $\\mathcal{R}$ than annihilates $v$.\nBut we can show, using the fact that $UP = P$ and $U",
    "<bos>Methylglyoxal activates NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and induces COX-2 expression via a p38-dependent pathway in synovial cells.\nThere is growing evidence of an increased prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) among people with diabetes. Synovial inflammation and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are two key features of patients with OA. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a common intermediate in the formation of advanced glycation end-products, and its concentration is also typically higher in diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of the treatment of different MGO concentrations to rabbit HIG-82 synovial cells on COX-2 expression. The MGO induced COX-2 mRNA expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The MGO induced COX-2 protein production and its signaling pathways were detected by western blotting. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation by MGO was examined by immunofluorescence. In the present study, we find that MGO has no toxic effects on rabbit synovial cells under the experimental conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that MGO induced COX-2 mRNA and protein production. Moreover, MGO induces p38-dependent COX-2 protein expression as well",

Kudos to learning something new!\nI have this database I create\ndatabase = DBManager(dbEndpoint,dbUser,dbPass,dbSchema)\n\nAnd then I try to use it in a thread\ndef stateTimeThreadStart():\n     database.getTable('CLIENTS')\n\nthreads = []\nthreads.append(threading.Thread(name='State Updater', target=stateTimeThreadStart, args=()))\nthreads[0].start()\n\nThe output is \nSegmentation fault: 11\n\nWhat on earth is going on here? It definetly has something to do with database.getTable('CLIENTS') because when I comment it out the issue does not occur. In addition, I have also tried to pass the database to the thread with no luck. Any ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA:\n\nSegmentation faults in Python can occur due to database connectors. The drivers used to connect to the database are usually coded in a C base, so in case of RAM overload or perhaps other reasons it throws Segmentation Faults.\nThis is further exacerbated by the fact that you are using multithreading.",

    "<bos>Abstract\n\nThe entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform cortex, and synaptic plasticity in this pathway may affect olfactory processing. In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin. Okadaic acid, which blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also prevented LTD. Activation of protein phosphatases following calcium influx therefore contributes to induction of LTD in layer II of the entorhinal cortex.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe mechanisms that mediate the\ninduction of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) [1, 2] and depression (LTD) [3\u20135]\nhave been studied intensively within the hippocampus, but less",
    "<bos>The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state\u2019s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\n\nHawaii\u2019s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\n\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a motor drive apparatus which is, for example, used for driving an X-Y table of a monolithic wire bonder or a die bonder serving as one of IC manufacturing apparatus, and a method of controlling the same.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nThere is known a method of accurately stopping a motor at a target position, as disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 55-77384/1980. In this prior art, after the motor passes through the target position, an error extreme point is obtained in order to determine a current value to be supplied to the motor to correct the error. Then, a rectangular current is supplied to the motor so as to eliminate the error and stop the motor at the target position.\nHereinafter, a background technology of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing one example of a motor drive apparatus controlling a typical three-phase synchronous motor. FIG. 11 is a detailed view showing a motor 1 of FIG. 10. FIG. 12 is a view showing inductive voltages of the motor 1 of FIG. 10",
    "<bos>The present invention relates generally to digital copy protection, digital rights management, and conditional access, and more particularly but not exclusively to enabling transferable entitlements using Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs) for providing content to different network devices.\nToday a consumer can readily purchase an entitlement to content such as a ticket to the opera, a sports event, movie, or the like. Often, the purchased ticket can be redeemed at some later stage and location. Similarly a consumer may purchase an airline ticket and redeem it for an airplane flight. However, there is a difference of transferability between these two ticket transactions. For various reasons, of both pricing and security, airline tickets represent non-transferable entitlements, where only the named recipient of the entitlement may redeem it, whereas movie tickets, or the like, are typically transferable.\nTransferability is an attribute of the entitlement granted by an original owner to the recipient. It means that the recipient may be free to resell or transfer title to the entitlement prior to its redemption. It also typically means that the owner or its distributors agree to honor the redemption of the entitlement from whoever presents the entitlement. Thus, in some situations, a transferable entitlement may become an object of trade.\nHowever, in today's realm of content, such",
    "<bos>I listened to this one, narrated by Justine Eyre. It was about 12 hours long, but it passed by quickly with this fun read. It's not particularly deep or magical and it doesn't call life as we know it into question.\n\nIt's a nice read/listen, light and intriguing for anyone in the mood for a little escape from the disappointments that have been abounding.\n\nFunny enough, the only problems with the book are also reasons why I liked it. Lily Kaiser's journey is a little too convenient throughout the book but that can be just perfect sometimes. It can be exactly what I need to read or listen in order to balance out the pressure of the world.\n\nSo, yes, the book is a little too neat. The story a little too beautiful and coincidental and works a little too well, but I didn't mind it at all. Mostly because it was also written incredibly well. It moves between times, giving insight into Rose Gallway's life that Lily doesn't readily have and let's the reader piece some of it together on our own. I do enjoy that. And then the author lays it all out and it's just perfect. A little too perfect, like in",
    "<bos>Examination of factors affecting gait properties in healthy older adults: focusing on knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain.\nGait properties change with age because of a decrease in lower limb strength and visual acuity or knee joint disorders. Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76.1 (5.7) years). Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and knee joint pain were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Among older adults without vision problems and knee joint pain that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had significantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P < .05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with pain in both knees showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. A decrease of knee extension strength and",
    "<bos>The Effects of Event Rate on a Cognitive Vigilance Task.\nThe present experiment sought to examine the effects of event rate on a cognitive vigilance task. Vigilance, or the ability to sustain attention, is an integral component of human factors research. Vigilance task difficulty has previously been manipulated through increasing event rate. However, most research in this paradigm has utilized a sensory-based task, whereas little work has focused on these effects in relation to a cognitive-based task. In sum, 84 participants completed a cognitive vigilance task that contained either 24 events per minute (low event rate condition) or 40 events per minute (high event rate condition). Performance was measured through the proportion of hits, false alarms, mean response time, and signal detection analyses (i.e., sensitivity and response bias). Additionally, measures of perceived workload and stress were collected. The results indicated that event rate significantly affected performance, such that participants who completed the low event rate task achieved significantly better performance in terms of correction detections and false alarms. Furthermore, the cognitive vigil utilized in the present study produced performance decrements comparable to traditional sensory vigilance tasks. Event rate affects cognitive vigilance tasks in a similar manner as traditional sensory vigilance tasks, such that a direct relation between performance and level of",

That is, different 2D images are displayed to the left eye and the right eye of a user viewing the display. When the image displayed to the left eye (hereafter referred to as \u201cleft-eye image\u201d) and the image displayed to the right eye (hereafter referred to as \u201cright-eye image\u201d) are processed by the user's brain, the brain recognizes the combination of the left-eye image and the right-eye image as a three-dimensional image having depth perception.\nA display device capable of displaying 3D images using binocular parallax is generally referred to as a stereoscopic 3D image display device. Some stereoscopic 3D image display devices may require the user to wear special headgear or eye glasses (e.g., shutter glasses and polarized glasses). Other stereoscopic 3D image display devices, referred to",

Unity is huge to God. It's huge in churches, from the leadership all the way to the last attender and even more it's huge in terms of the Church with a big 'C'... the collective Christ-followers and the churches in which they worship throughout our nation and world. The verses in God's Word that discuss the importance of unity are prolific and the urgency with which the concept is discussed is palpable.\n\nAll that said, I wanted to write a worship song that, at it's core, could help unify the congregation singing it. I used 'we' language on this one--something I haven't used a ton in the past--because the lyric and theme begged for it, and I searched for words that could articulate the depth of unity that I believe God desires from us. I think the lyric I'm most proud of in this particular song kicks off the second verse:\n\nAll of our brothers and sisters through time have sung of the blood of the same sacrifice",
    "<bos>Longitudinal impedance variability in patients with chronically implanted DBS devices.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy for advanced movement disorders, but its optimal use is still controversial. One factor that could play a role in the proper delivery of therapeutic stimulation by current DBS devices is the variability of the impedance at the interface between the electrode surface and surrounding tissue. To analyze variability and trends in the impedance of chronically-implanted DBS electrodes in subjects with movement disorders. We reviewed impedance values from medical records of DBS patients at an academic tertiary-care movement disorders center. The standard deviation of data recorded within individual subjects and single contacts were used as measures of longitudinal impedance variability. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) determined if a number of effects had significant influences on impedance. We analyzed 2863 impedance measurements from 94 subjects. Median variability, for subjects with follow-up from 6 months to 5 years (n = 77), was 194 \u03a9 for individual subjects and 141 \u03a9 for individual contacts, with a range spanning from 18 to over 600 \u03a9. The GLMM, incorporating all subjects (n = 94), identified time, electrical activity, implanted target, contact position on the",

Removable partial denture (RPD) is commonly used because of its availability. RPDs from flexible resins unlike those from acrylic engage hard and soft tissue undercuts and feel more comfortable in the mouth. The aim of the study was to compare satisfaction with dentures made from these two types of materials. It was a quasi-experimental study among thirty patients at the Prosthetics Clinic, University College Hospital, Ibadan. Patients aged 16 years or more, requiring RPDs with one to three missing teeth in the anterior region of either the upper or lower arch participated. A modified semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographics and oral health variables. The level of satisfaction was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Data were analysed using descriptive and multivariate statistics at a significance level of P < 0.05. The participants' ages ranged between 16 and 51 years, mean age was 33.8 \u00b1 10.01 years. Male: female ratio was 1:1 and mean duration of edentulousness was 11.37 \u00b1",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nSend user to edit page without inserting the record\n\nI currently have an Apex class that pulls the data from a record of one custom object 'property__c' and uses it to create a record of another object 'proposal__c' and then redirects the user to this new record's edit view.\nHowever, there's a problem with this. On the edit page, if the user hits \"cancel,\" the record is still inserted. This is because in order to direct the user to the edit view of the new record, we have to first insert that record so that we can pull its id.\nOutside of making a custom edit view for this object, is it possible to send the user to the edit view without inserting the record first? This would ideally behave the same as if the user simply hit the \"new\" button and then \"cancel.\" The only difference is, we want some of the fields of the record to be pre-populated.\nHere is the code.

    "<bos>Neighbors (novel)\n\nNeighbors is a 1980 novel by American author Thomas Berger. It is a satire of manners and suburbia, and a comment on emotional alienation with echoes of the works of Franz Kafka. Earl Keese\u2019s character and situation begin realistically but become increasingly fantastic. Keese is an Everyman whose life is swiftly turned upside down. As he scrambles to reclaim his sense of normalcy and dignity, he comes to think that everyone, including his family, is against him.\n\nPlot summary \n\nEarl Keese is a middle-aged, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and teenage daughter, Elaine. Earl is content with his dull, unexceptional life, but this changes when a younger, less sophisticated couple, Harry and Ramona, move in next door. Harry is physically intimidating and vulgar; Ramona is sexually aggressive, and both impose themselves on the Keese household. Their free-spirited personalities and overbearing and boorish behavior endear them to Enid and Elaine, but Earl fears that he is losing control of his life and his family. Over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare.\n\nAnalysis \nBerger's off-kilter",

    "<bos>Free peritoneal tumour cells are an independent prognostic factor in curatively resected stage IB gastric carcinoma.\nSeveral studies have shown that the cytological detection of free peritoneal tumour cells (FPTCs) in patients with gastric cancer indicates the presence of metastatic disease. The immunocytochemical detection of FPTCs, especially in early-stage tumours, has not been examined comprehensively. Peritoneal lavage was performed in 351 patients before curative resection of a gastric carcinoma between 1987 and 2001, and an adequate sample was obtained from 346 patients. FPTCs were detected immunocytochemically using Ber-EP4 antibody. Median follow-up time was 70 months. FPTCs were detected in the lavage fluid of 74 patients (21.4 per cent) and correlated with increasing pathological tumour depth (pT) and lymph node (pN) status (P < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival of patients with FPTCs was significantly worse than that of patients without FPTCs (35 versus 71.9 per cent; P < 0.001). FPTCs were present in 14 (8.5 per cent",
    "<bos>The long term objective is to characterize key functionalities of the epithelial cells of the larval mosquito gut as these cellular functions influence and regulate the anionic basis of alkalinization of the gut lumen. A detailed understanding of how gut epithelial cells produce the remarkable and biologically unique pH extremes (i.e. > 10.5) that drive the digestive process will provide new avenues for the development of environmentally safe and specific larvacides. Two specific gene families have been targeted as they have central roles in anion production and transport in the gut alkalinization process: carbonic anhydrases and transmembrane anion transporters. This project will produce molecular and physiological characterizations of members of these two gene families. Their distributions in the tissue and specific roles in larval mosquito gut alkalinization will be defined. Specific cellular phenotypes throughout the gut will be defined and the role of each in the alkalinization process assessed. AIM 1 will examine the expression of multiple carbonic anhydrases. AIM 2 will define and characterize members of the anion transporter gene family. AIM 3 will define the cellular distributions of carbonic anhydrases and anion transporters in the gut and as functions of larval development. AIM 4 will produce a global analysis of gene expression in the specific functional domains of the larval mosquito gut identifying key functionalities",

After a promising debut with \"The Living End\" followed by the angrier, more marginalized \"Totally F***ed Up,\" Mr. Araki is still sounding a note of self-congratulatory teen-age rebellion in a film gruesome and obvious enough to make \"Natural Born Killers\" look like a model of restraint.\n\nIt's not even much of a change to find \"The Doom Generation\" billed as \"a heterosexual movie,\" since it shares the effective homoerotic energy of his earlier work. That this film includes a teen-age girl, Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), as part of its sexual menage only means one especially clear target of contempt (\"Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot\" is one of the more printable things anyone says to her)",

Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs it encompasses  and began interments in 1988. It is now one of the busiest cemeteries in the United States.\n\nHistory\nFlorida National Cemetery is located in the Withlacoochee State Forest, approximately  north of Tampa. The forest was acquired by the federal government from private landowners between 1936 and 1939 under the provisions of the U.S. Land Resettlement Administration. The United States Forest Service managed the property until a lease-purchase agreement transferred it to the Florida Board of Forestry in 1958. Currently, Withlacoochee State Forest is the second-largest state forest in Florida, divided into eight distinct tracts of land.\n\nIn 1842, Congress encouraged settlement here by establishing the Armed Occupation Act. The law granted a patent for  to any man who kept a gun and ammunition, built a house, cultivated  of the land and remained there for at least five years. Settlers moved in to take advantage of the generous offer. The area contained abundant timber and suitable farmland,",
    "<bos>Ask HN: How to approach two competing job offers - is bidding war an option? - mbord\n\nI studied Computer Science, and I recently graduated as a bachelor. I went on to apply to two major Silicon Valley companies, let's call them A and B, and aced the interviews.<p>I got an offer from A, which I would have happily accepted had I not had another company still contemplating their offer. Now B contacted me, not yet ready to give an offer, but they mentioned that their offer would likely be significantly larger if they would be able to see the offer from A in writing.<p>I got my offer from A both verbally and in informal writing to my e-mail. I find it clear that if I asked them for the offer in writing now, they would certainly know what's happening (given that I've kept them waiting for some time now). I told this to B already previously, they understood, but it would certainly benefit me if I had it in writing now.<p>How should this game be played in your opinion? I actually prefer A, and if B's offer were roughly the same size, I would be very happy to take A. However, I am wondering whether I am a",
    "<bos>Milestones to recovery: preliminary validation of a framework to promote recovery and map progress through the medium secure inpatient pathway.\nForensic mental health care in the UK has undergone a rapid expansion since the late 1990s. In medium secure units (MSUs), there is growing emphasis on developing care pathways without much theoretical underpinning. We developed a concept of 'Milestones to Recovery' (MTR) to measure progress through the MSU pathway. Our aim was to validate the MTR framework. Our hypotheses were that patients scoring higher on the MTR Scale would be more likely to be aggressive to others in the following 6 months and resident in the acute areas of the unit and that those scoring lower would be more likely to be discharged within 6 months of the assessment. An MTR scale was developed to enable the investigation of the validity of the MTR framework and evaluated with staff evaluations of 80 resident patients using a prospective, longitudinal and naturalistic design. The results suggest that the MTR framework is valid in discriminating between different stages on the MSU pathway. Therapeutic engagement was particularly important in terms of progress through the MSU, whereas current behaviour was important in predicting future aggression. Further research is required to test the MTR framework across different levels of security, with",
    "<bos>Rigid stretchers for transporting injured patients are well known. Certain known rigid stretchers are partially collapsible. These stretchers include one or more rigid support panels or beams. Because of the rigid panels or beams, these stretchers can be relatively heavy and cumbersome when handled by emergency personnel during rescue operations, and these stretchers can occupy a relatively significant amount of space in vehicles and other storage areas. Also, these known stretchers do not include a patient covering which aids in the protection of emergency personnel from hazardous body fluids from the patient and which guards the front of patient's body during transport.\nOne known rescue bag has been developed for keeping injured people warm while they are lying on stretchers. Though this rescue bag covers part of the patient's body, it is merely an accessory to a stretcher. Accordingly, one of the disadvantages of this rescue bag is that it does not function as a patient carrier. The emergency personnel must use a stretcher in conjunction with this rescue bag in order to pick-up, carry and transport an injured person to a desired location. In addition, such a rescue bag does not have medical treatment openings which provide emergency personnel with relatively quick access to select portions of the person's body, for example, to deliver essential treatments, such as IV",

Including this.\n\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\n\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\n\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer.

    "<bos>Genetic diversity studies of Brazilian garlic cultivars and quality control of garlic-clover production.\nThe garlic cultivars grown in Brazil evolved from somatic mutations and clone selection by breeding programs and by the introduction of germplasm from other countries. Morphological characters have been used to differentiate these cultivars. Two hundred and six random amplified polymorphic DNA markers were utilized for a diversity analysis of the 17 most planted garlic cultivars in Brazil. Bootstrap analysis showed that the number of markers was efficient and sufficient to obtain a coefficient of variation of 10%. Similarity varied between 16 and 98% and cluster analysis showed that, in general, genetic similarities correlate with morphological characters of the cultivars and production cycle variation. High bootstrap values at most of the nodes supported the dendrogram stability. The grouping of most varieties agreed well with previous reports based on morphological characters. As a vegetative-propagated species, viral diseases are a key problem regarding production and quality of the bulbs, causing gradual loss of yield and decrease in storage capacity. To improve the health quality of garlic seed, a virus-free stock of garlic cloves of the Amarante cultivar was obtained. The ability to distinguish garlic cultivars to detect varietal mixing after in vitro multiplication is extremely important, since correct identification is not possible until bulbs are",

    "<bos>The present invention relates generally to improved means and methods for processing documents using electronic imaging, and more particularly, to the use of electronic imaging for processing financial documents, such as checks and related documents in a banking environment.\nToday's financial services industry is facing the immense challenge of processing huge amounts of documents efficiently. Predictions that document payment methods would decline have not been realized. In fact, document payment methods have grown worldwide and are expected to continue increasing. There is thus a vital need to devise improved means and methods for processing such documents.\nThe use of imaging technology as an aid to document processing has been recognized as one way of significantly improving document processing, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,205,780, 4,264,808, and 4,672,186. Generally, imaging involves optically scanning documents to produce electronic images that are processed electronically and stored on high capacity storage media (such as magnetic disc drives and/or optical memory) for later retrieval and display. It is apparent that document imaging provides the opportunity to reduce document handling and movement, since these electronic images can be used in place of the actual documents.\nHowever, despite",
    "<bos>PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE): Rationale and trial design.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the US, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of these deaths. While efforts aimed at treating CAD in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. CAD is commonly treated using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this treatment has increased exponentially since its adoption over three decades ago. Recent questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in CAD is exercise therapy; exercise programs have been shown to have numerous physiological benefits, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated reductions in mortality. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise, the current study is termed \"PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise\" (PAUSE).

    "<bos>Mai-Mai\n\nThe term Mayi-Mayi or Mai-Mai refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry.\n\nGroups that fall under the umbrella term \"Mai-Mai\" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.\n\nMai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the \"Kivus\"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy\u2013Goma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War",
    "<bos>Dorsomedial hypothalamic lesions alter intake of an imbalanced amino acid diet in rats.\nWithin 3 h of ingesting an imbalanced amino acid diet (IAAD), rats show attenuated intake. The associated conditioned taste aversion can be ameliorated by giving the serotonin3 receptor blocker, tropisetron (TROP). A recent c-fos study indicated that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) may be activated 2-3 h after ingestion of IAAD. In Experiment 1, DMN-lesioned rats (DMNL) or sham-operated (SHAM) rats were injected with saline (SAL) or TROP just before introduction of IAAD. By 3 h, SAL-DMNL rats consumed more (P < 0.01) of the IAAD than did the SAL-SHAM rats. Thereafter, over the next 21 h, the intake of the SAL-DMNL group returned to control levels. TROP treatment enhanced the intake of the treated groups; the TROP and the lesion effect were additive (P < 0.01). By d 4 of receiving the IAAD, the DMNL groups were eating less than SHAM rats (P < 0.0",
    "<bos>Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\n\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\n\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement",

    "<bos>Four-ever? Competition remedies in the audit market\n\nOxera\n\nIn light of recent accounting scandals, there are widespread calls for the UK competition authority to re-examine the audit market. Yet spending a substantial amount of resources on a market investigation, and concluding once again that there is a competition problem, is of little value if a suitable remedy cannot be found. A break-up of the Big Four is perceived by many as a necessary and long-awaited intervention, but is it the right solution? And if not, what would be an alternative remedy?\n\nThe UK audit market has gone through some turmoil recently.[1] This month the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which regulates UK audit, announced a deterioration in audit quality across the \u2018Big Four\u2019 firms (KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY) compared with the previous year. Most notably, the FRC noted that 50% of KPMG\u2019s FTSE 350 audits failed to reach the FRC\u2019s standard for audit quality.[2] At a global level, the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators found significant problems in 40% of the 918 audits of listed public interest entities that it inspected last year.[3]\n\nThe recent audit failures uncovered by regulators",
    "<bos>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII?? is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1. In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies",

    "<bos>How Idris Elba's 'Luther' Puts Us in the Mindset of a Renegade Detective\n\n\"Luther\" is a series about righteous indignation. Yes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals.\n\nYes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody version of London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals. But the satisfaction of seeing those cases solved, those murderers and kidnappers caught, is muted, secondary to the suffering and sacrifice and validation of protagonist John Luther, the detective played by Idris Elba with a staggering display of movie star charisma that seems like it ought to produce static shocks with everything with which he comes into contact. Luther's devoted to his job with an obsessiveness that's destroying him, that, as the series began in 2010, had ended his marriage and eaten him up inside, changing him. He's good at what he does, if prone to extremes, and yet he seems to be perpetually doubted, maligned and hurt because of it.\n\nIn season one",
    "<bos>Ability of MR cholangiography to reveal stent position and luminal diameter in patients with biliary endoprostheses: in vitro measurements and in vivo results in 30 patients.\nOur goal was to evaluate the ability of MR cholangiography to show stent position and luminal diameter in patients with biliary endoprostheses. Susceptibility artifacts were evaluated in vitro in three different stent systems (cobalt alloy-based, nitinol-based, and polyethylene) using two breath-hold sequences (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement, half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo) on a 1.5-T MR imaging system. The size of the stent-related artifact was measured, and the relative stent lumen was calculated. In vivo stent position and patency were determined in 30 patients (10 cobalt alloy-based stents, five nitinol-based stents, and 15 polyethylene stents). In vitro, the susceptibility artifact of the cobalt stent caused complete obliteration of the stent lumen. The relative stent lumens of the nitinol-based and polyethylene stents were 38-50% and 67-100%, respectively. In vivo, all stents were patent at the time of imaging. The",

    "<bos>Major League Baseball All-Century Team\n\nIn 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.\n\nThe top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:\u2014Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).\n\nThe nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.\n\nFor the complete list of the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team.\n\nSelected players",

    "<bos>The case of the vanished sword\n\nBy\nwashingtonpost.com editors\n\nBy John Lockwood\nWashington\n\nOne of our memorials is missing a sword.\n\nThe General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\n\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\n\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a"

    "<bos>My Hero Academia Season 2- Episode 18\n\nAfter last weeks episode, I was really curious what they had in store for us this week. How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named \u201cThe Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain\u201d.\n\nMy Hero Academia- Funimation\n\nWe open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.\n\nMy Hero Academia- Funimation\n\nA tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It\u2019s Hosu\u2019s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper.

    "<bos>---\nabstract: |\n    We give a general construction of debiased/locally robust/orthogonal (LR) moment functions for GMM, where the derivative with respect to first step nonparametric estimation is zero and equivalently first step estimation has no effect on the influence function. This construction consists of adding an estimator of the influence function adjustment term for first step nonparametric estimation to identifying or original moment conditions. We also give numerical methods for estimating LR moment functions that do not require an explicit formula for the adjustment term.\n\n    LR moment conditions have reduced bias and so are important when the first step is machine learning. We derive LR moment conditions for dynamic discrete choice based on first step machine learning estimators of conditional choice probabilities.\n\n    We provide simple and general asymptotic theory for LR estimators based on sample splitting. This theory uses the additive decomposition of LR moment conditions into an identifying condition and a first step influence adjustment. Our conditions require only mean square consistency and a few (generally either one or two) readily interpretable rate conditions.\n\n    LR moment functions have the advantage of being less sensitive to first step estimation. Some LR moment functions are also doubly robust meaning they hold if one first step is incorrect. We give novel classes of doubly robust moment functions and characterize double robustness",
    "<bos>Tag Archive for interact\n\nQuestion by Jon: What is the best way to interact with or select job recruiters?\nI work primarily as a front end web developer and get calls from multiple recruitment firms. I do a fair bit of project work, so this is a recurring thing for me. Currently, if they have a position that I\u2019m a fit for I reflexively ask them to present me for that position. Is that an optimal strategy? If one company submits me, another cannot, so I want to be submitted by the best company. Should I therefore be taking steps to identify which recruiting firms are the most effective, give preference to local firms, find which firms ask the target employer for a smaller fee, select (somehow) for firms that have a better relationship with the target client, check out a firm\u2019s reputation online before submittal, etc. Or is all of that wasted work?\n\nI\u2019m looking for things that are efficient yet effective. Thanks for any tips!\nYes, I know I can work with several agencies for different jobs. However I CAN\u2019T work with several agencies for the SAME JOB. Not in California, in any case. Double submissions get thrown out, or else the second agency to submit is rejected.",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nAre all I2C sensors interoperable?\n\nI have a quadcopter flight controller (RTFQ Flip MWC) that supports I2C sensors for adding thing like a barometer, magnetometer, and GPS system. The officially supported sensor block (BMP180, HMC5883L on one board) is discontinued, as far as I can tell. \nI have found other I2C barometer and magnetometer sensors, (BMP280, LSM303) but I am not even sure if all I2C devices of the same type are interoperable. Do they all look the same (at least interface-wise) to the flight controller?\nI'm also new to I2C in general; the sensors I need come on two separate boards. Do I just stack the boards, directly connecting the I2C bus between each?\nThanks in advance,\nNeil\nEDIT:\nI was able to find the datasheets for the discontinued and proposed sensors:\n\nBMP180\nHMC5883L\nBMP280\nLSM303\n\nAll are compatible with the 3.3v output of the Flip MWC, which is good.",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nXML Schema for analysis in C#\n\nIs it possible to use a XML Schema to check against the contents of a XML file?\nFor instance, in ASP.NET web.config, can I create a schema to check that <customErrors mode = \"On\">? This will ultimately be used in a C# app, the C# app should take in the XML document and the XML Schema and check if the XML Document violates any of the \"rules\" listed in the XML schema, i.e. <customErrors mode = \"Off\">\nIs it possible to do the checking without any boundary to the structure of the XML file? i.e. the attribute <customErrors> can be within any part of the XML document and the schema will still work.\n\nA:\n\nPossible: Yes, in XML Schema 1.1 using assertions.\nPractical or recommended: No.\nXML Schema is intended to be used to validate the \"structure of the XML file,\" as you anticipate in your question.  You can skip much of that via xsd:any and then use assertions to express the sort of spot-checks that you describe via XPath expressions.  However, it'd be more natural to just apply XPath expressions directly",
    "<bos>Historical conceptualizations of depression\n===========================================\n\nThere is a long tradition in phenomenologlcal psychopathology that stresses basic bodily alterations as core features of depressive states. Thus, Wernicke used the term \"vital feelings\" to describe certain somatic symptoms occurring in affective psychoses.^[@ref1]^ Vital feelings refer to the close relationship of the body to the awareness of self. They determine the way we experience our body and the impression we assume our physical presence makes on other people. Vital feelings are somatic affects localized In different parts of the body. Whereas vital feelings constitute the bodily background of our normal experiences, they may move to the fore In a depressive mood. For example, depressed patients very often complain of a headache which is described not exactly as an ordinary pain, but more as an unbearable pressure \"like a band around the head.\" Other disturbed vital feelings affect the chest or the abdomen, and mediate unpleasant sensations of weight, tension, heaviness, or Inhibition, totally absorbing the focus of attention. In quite a similar way Dupr\u00e9 speaks of \"coenestopathic states\" which mean a distressing, qualitative change of normal physical feeling In certain areas of the body during an episode of depressive mood. It Is a global loss of vitality In which all bodily parts and functions",
    "<bos>Formulation and application of a biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus as collector in the flotation of oily water in industrial environment.\nThe present study describes the formulation of a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP1616 and investigates its long-term stability for application as a collector in a bench-scale dissolved air flotation (DAF) prototype. For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by",

HBV, together with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and several other related animal viruses, belongs to the *Hepadnaviridae* family ([@B2]). The HBV virion is comprised of an outer envelope and an inner icosahedral nucleocapsid (NC) assembled by 240 copies of core protein (HBc) and packaged with a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded circular DNA genome ([@B3][@B4][@B8]). In addition to DNA-containing virions, a large amount of incomplete viral particles, such as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles, empty virions, and naked capsids, can also be released from cells in the process of virus replication ([@B9]). Subviral HBsAg particles are spherical or rodlike and are present in vast excess over virions in sera of CHB patients ([@B2]). Empty virions share the same structure as DNA-containing virions but are devoid of nucleic acids ([@B1",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nIs it focus or depth of field?\n\nI was trying to shoot a group of people standing clumped but at different distances, quite close to me, think disorganized portrait. I have a Nikon d750,  and was not able to get everyone into focus.  If I brought the people closer to me in focus, then the background were blurred and vice versa.  I pushed the aperture all the way to f18 or so and it didn't bring the whole scene into focus.  Was I shooting from too close ....  Or this makes me wonder is this about AF-S vs AF-A instead of aperture and the camera choosing one point to focus upon instead of the area?  How would you compose a group shot like this to all be in focus?  Thanks! \n\nA:\n\nIt sounds like depth of field.  If (with an APS crop sensor, 30 mm lens, f/4), if you focus at say 6 feet you might have about 2 feet of DOF span, like from 5 feet to 7 feet (coarse approximations).  If your subject is distributed at say 6 to 8 feet, this 5-7 DOF zone does not include",

    "<bos>Cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children: data from benign rolandic epilepsy.\nThe effects of antiepileptic drugs on cognition are difficult to delineate, yet of critical importance for children with epilepsy. We investigated the cognitive and behavioral effects of carbamazepine in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Ten subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy were evaluated with and without carbamazepine treatment. Fourteen unmedicated subjects with migraine headache evaluated twice served as a control group. Subjects were 6 to 12 years of age, fluent in English, and not mentally retarded. We found that children with benign rolandic epilepsy were quicker on a visual-search task and recalled stories better when not treated than when treated with carbamazepine. After correction for multiple comparisons only the memory finding remained significant. Higher carbamazepine serum level was associated with slower performance on the same visual-search task. This latter finding did not meet multiple comparison criteria. Numerous significant practice effects were found within the control group. Comparisons with reliable change indices identified two subjects with benign rolandic epilepsy with particularly poor scores while receiving carbamazepine. These findings suggest some effects on memory from carbamazepine; however, they do not support meaningful dosage-related effects, within the recommended range. Significant practice effects",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nbootstrap.min.css sets transparency where not wanted\n\nI have a small chatbox at the bottom of my page which seems to be inheriting CSS style from bootstrap.min.css and that chatbox is transparent which is a nuisance because the underlying text on the page shows through and what is worse, is that hyperlinks on the page are over-riding clickable areas in the chatbox for opening, closing and submitting messages.\nI have tried adding CSS style to the chatbox for opacity and rgba. Even tried adding a background image but to no effect.\nI have since modified the chatbox to display an iFrame from a different site that does not use bootstrap.min.css.\nBut even the iFrame page is affected by transparency. I can remove the transparency setting in bootstrap.min.css but that will not solve my bigger problem... I am intending to use this chatbox on several sites and may not have control of the site's CSS.\nSo I need a way to override the parent site's CSS just for the chatbox. \nIf that is impossible, then I can  weed out the transparency from bootstrap.min.css that is used on my own sites.

It is one of the most important and influential trade unions in the History of Mexico.\n\nIt was founded in April 1952. during a congress made by four workers centrals. Until 1980 the CROC had 750 000 workers inside the union, in only 17 of the 31 states and the Federal District (Mexico City); in this year the statements change in order to change the organization of the union by changing the presidency of the union, that was rotative and with only one year of duration to a presidency headed by a National Secretary General (Secretario General del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo Nacional).\n\nIt currently has 4.5 million worker members throughout the 32 states in the country having also 17 National Industrial Confederacies; also 3.600 unions with 15 000 collective contracts.\n\nExternal links \nHistory of the Confederaci\u00f3n Revolucionaria de Obreros y Campesinos (Campesinos an Workers Revolutionary Confederacy) \n\nCategory:National",

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\n\nA:\n\nwhy was he banned?\nI'm",
    "<bos>This invention relates generally to enzymes that convert sucrose to isomaltulose. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel sucrose isomerases, to polynucleotides encoding these enzymes, to methods for isolating such polynucleotides and to nucleic acid constructs that express these polynucleotides. The invention also relates to cells, particularly transformed bacterial or plant cells, and to differentiated plants comprising cells, which express these polynucleotides. The invention further relates to the use of the polypeptides, polynucleotides, cells and plants of the invention for producing isomaltulose.\nIsomaltulose \u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-1,6-D-fructofuranose (also called palatinose) is a naturally occurring structural isomer of sucrose (\u03b1-D-glucosyl-1,2-D-fructose). Isomaltulose is a nutritive disaccharide, with sweetness and bulk similar to sucrose. Several characteristics make isomaltulose advantageous over sucrose for some applications in the food industry: 1) noncariogenic (not causing dental decay); 2) low glycemic index (useful for diabetics); 3) selective promotion of growth of beneficial bifidobacteria among human intestinal microflora; 4) greater stability of",
    "<bos>During my pregnancy, I tried to gather as much information on how painful labor might actually be. I would often hear \u201cmine was horrible, but everyone\u2019s pregnancy is different\u201d or \u201cit was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life!\u201d\n\nI heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\n\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\n\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.",
    "<bos>From the mid-1960's until the close of that decade, automobiles became lighter, more compact, and more powerful. Auto manufacturers continued to compete against one another for drag-strip supremacy. As government regulations and safety concerns increased, the muscle car era began to decline rapidly.\n\nMany of these ultimate high-performance muscle cars were built to satisfy homologation requirements. Others were built just to have the fastest machine on the road. The Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda is an example of one of the fiercest and most powerful vehicle ever constructed for the roadway. It was derived from the lesser Barracuda's which began in the mid-1960's. It was built atop the 'E' body platform and was restyled in 1970 by John Herlitz, making it longer, wider, and lower. The 426 cubic-inch Hemi V8 was capable of producing an astonishing 425 horsepower. Matted to a four-speed manual 833 transmission, this was the ultimate muscle car of its day.\n\nThis 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible with black paint and orange billboards was offered for sale at the 2006 RM Auction in",
    "<bos>Perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to visual recognition memory can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures based on conscious awareness of prior occurrence.\nThe ability of humans to distinguish consciously between new and previously encountered objects can be probed with visual recognition memory tasks that require explicit old-new discriminations. Medial temporal-lobe (MTL) lesions impair performance on such tasks. Within the MTL, both perirhinal cortex and the hippocampus have been implicated. Cognitive processes can also be affected by past object encounters in the absence of conscious recognition, as in repetition priming tasks. Past functional neuroimaging findings in healthy individuals suggest that even in tasks that require conscious recognition decisions for visual stimuli, posterior cortical structures in the ventral visual pathway distinguish between old and new objects at a nonconscious level. Conclusive evidence that differentiates the neural underpinnings of conscious from nonconscious processes in recognition memory, however, is still missing. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for the MTL have been inconsistent towards this end. In the present fMRI study, we tested whether perirhinal and hippocampal contributions to recognition memory can be distinguished from those of occipito-temporal structures in the ventral visual pathway based on the participants' reported conscious awareness of prior occurrence.

    "<bos>Effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mutans to microfilled composite resin and giomer surfaces.\nSurface attributes of a restoration play an important role in adherence of plaque bacteria. Prophylaxis methods may be involved in modification of or damaging the restoration surface. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of two prophylaxis methods on adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of two restorative materials. A total of 60 specimens were prepared from each material; a microfilled composite resin (HelioProgress) and a giomer (Beautifil II). For each material, the specimens were randomly divided into three groups (n=20). Group 1: no prophylaxis treatment (control); Group 2: prophylaxis with pumice and rubber cup; Group 3: prophylaxis with air-powder polishing device (APD). The surfaces of selected specimens from each group were evaluated under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the surface topography formed by the two prophylaxis methods was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Adherence of Streptococcus mutans to the surface of specimens was determined by the plate counting method following immersion in a bacterial innoculum for 4 hours, rinsing and sonication. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test",
    "<bos>One hundred years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasing health problem and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but knowledge about its pathogenesis has increased substantially in recent years. The disease results from interaction between individual risk factors (like enzymatic deficiencies) and environmental exposures to noxious agents, like cigarette smoking, occupational dusts, air pollution and infections in childhood. The main mechanisms that may contribute to airflow limitation in COPD are fixed narrowing of small airways, emphysema and luminal obstruction with mucus secretions. COPD is characterised by a chronic inflammatory process in the pulmonary tissue, with a pattern different from bronchial asthma, associated with extrapulmonary effects and is considered now a complex, systemic disease. Optimal therapeutic targeting of COPD depends on a clear understanding of the precise mechanisms of these complex processes and on early and correct evaluation of disease severity. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches is used to treat COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD treatment and can be combined with inhaled corticosteroids for greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The use of LTOT for hypoxemic patients has resulted in increased survival, and expanded drug therapy options have effectively improved dyspnoea and quality of life. Recent studies have",
    "<bos>Dietary sodium chloride intake independently predicts the degree of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in healthy humans consuming a net acid-producing diet.\nWe previously demonstrated that typical American net acid-producing diets predict a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the diet net acid load as indexed by the steady-state renal net acid excretion rate (NAE). We now investigate whether a sodium (Na) chloride (Cl) containing diet likewise associates with a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the sodium chloride content of the diet as indexed by the steady-state Na and Cl excretion rates. In the steady-state preintervention periods of our previously reported studies comprising 77 healthy subjects, we averaged in each subject three to six values of blood hydrogen ion concentration ([H]b), plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO(3)(-)]p), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)), the urinary excretion rates of Na, Cl, NAE, and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CrCl), and performed multivariate analyses. Dietary Cl strongly correlated positively with dietary Na (P < 0.001) and was an independent negative predictor of [HCO(3)(-)]p after adjustment for diet net acid load, Pco(2) and",

However, it is unknown in the lateral decubitus position. We thus compared forced-air warming on the upper and lower bodies in the lateral position. Patients (n=123) were randomised to receive forced-air warming on the upper body or lower body during thoracoscopic surgery in the lateral position. We measured the nasopharyngeal temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after lateral positioning during surgery and the infrared tympanic membrane temperature at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after surgery. Patients received both upper and lower body warming at a temperature of <35.5\u00b0C. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia with a temperature of <36.0\u00b0C. Intraoperative hypothermia was less frequent with the upper body warming than with the lower body warming {",

    "<bos>[A meningioma in the posterior fossa without dural attachment: case report].\nAn extremely rare case of a meningioma in the posterior fossa without dural attachment has been reported. The patient was a 56-year-old male whose chief manifestation was the abnormality of his CT scan. His past history included gastric and colonic polyp when he was 54, 55 years old, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before hospitalization in our department. CT scan showed a small round non-enhancing lesion located at the lateral site of the right cerebellar cortex. T1 weighted image of MRI showed a homogeneous low intensity lesion with partial enhancing with Gd-DTPA. Proton image showed a remarkable low intensity lesion which showed an extramedullary mass. Right retromastoid craniectomy was performed. The mass was an extramedullary tumor which had no relation with the cerebellar cortex and dura matter. The arachnoid membrane around the tumor was intact. The tumor was totally resected and the patient had no neurological deficits. Histopathologically, the tumor was delineated into laminar structures by collagen fiber. Tumor cells were spindle in shape and made a whorling formation.

    "<bos>Q:\n\nHow to change XML from dataset into HTML UL\n\nI'm working on a C# webforms application and have a datalayer which gathers information about the menu a customer can see, based on their customer number and order type.\nI was using the ASP.NET menu control for this until the qa department asked to change the menu to expand on click instead of hover.  At that point, I decided to try and do the menu with a simpler css/html/jquery approach but I've hit a jam.\nI have the following method in my datalayer that gets information for the menu and returns it as XML.  What I'm stuck on is how to take the XML that was being gathered, when I was using the menu control and hopefully reformat it into a UL for using in the html/css approach I'd like to do.  \npublic static string BuildMenu(string cprcstnm, string docType)\n    {\n        DataSet ds = new DataSet();\n        string connStr = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"DynamicsConnectionString\"].ConnectionString;\n        using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connStr))\n        {\n            string sql = \"usp_SelectItemMenuByCustomer\";",

    "<bos>The bantamweight champion of DEEP, Takafumi Otsuka, will take on Koichi Ishiuzka on May 13th at Differ Ariake in Tokyo.\n\nOtsuka was supposed to fight Fernando Vieira for the WSOF-GC bantamweight title in December. However, the Brazilian was over the weight at the first weigh-in and never showed up at the second weigh-in. Vieira was nowhere to be found after this.The Brazilian basically fled from the entire show.\n\nOtsuka became the inaugural WSOF-GC champ but this means, the last time he fought was back in August of last year. That was, however, against a Mongolian fighter named Baataryn Azjavkhlan who was 1-0 at the time.\n\nIn terms of competitive fight, vs Daisuke Engo in February 2016 maybe is the last time Otsuka went through, which is more than a year ago.\n\nIshizuka is basically born and raised in DEEP.\n\nAnd, he is undefeated in the last ten fights.\n\nFor Ishizuka, this must be the opportunity he has been looking for all of his pro MMA career.\n\nSo, Ishizuka has to be motivated than ever.",
    "<bos>jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nI am the developer of jOOQ, a Java database abstraction framework. I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > \"ROM\").\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nObject Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.\n\nObject/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]\n\nYour query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nSorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your",

    "<bos>Twist relates to tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and interstitial fibrogenesis in the obstructed kidney.\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in renal fibrosis. It has been recently reported that a transcription factor, Twist, plays a pivotal role in metastasis of breast tumors by inducing EMT. In this study, we examined whether Twist relates to renal fibrogenesis including EMT of tubular epithelia, evaluating Twist expression level in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. Kidneys of mice subjected to UUO were harvested 1, 3, 7, and 10 days after obstruction. Compared with control kidneys, Twist mRNA-level significantly increased 3 days after UUO (UUO day 3 kidney) and further augmented until 10 days after UUO. Twist expression increased in tubular epithelia of the dilated tubules and the expanded interstitial areas of UUO kidneys, where cell-proliferating appearances were frequently found in a time-dependent manner. Although a part of tubular cells in whole nephron segment were immunopositive for Twist in UUO day 7 kidneys, tubular epithelia downstream of nephron more frequently expressed Twist than upstream of nephron. In UUO day 7 kidneys, some tubular epithelia were",

In such supranational union that is neither a pure intergovernmental organization nor a true federal state, political institutions appear vague and somewhat obscure and indistinguishable.\n\nAre Iran and Saudi Arabia going to war? They are already fighting \u2013 by proxy \u2013 all over the region.

Twenty-three adults with hearing loss were separated into 2 groups. Thirteen subjects (6 men, 7 women, mean age, 25.7 +/- 3.9 years) constituted the intervention group, whereas 10 subjects (5 men, 5 women, mean age, 26.4 +/- 5.9 years) formed the control group. Pretraining and posttraining treadmill tests were performed to determine heart rate (HR peak), peak minute ventilation (VE peak), peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak, absolute and relative), and time to exhaustion (min). Peak torque of hamstring and quadriceps muscles at angular velocities of 60 degrees /s, 180 degrees /s, and 300 degrees /s was also measured. The intervention group followed a 12-week traditional dance training program, whereas the control group received no training during this period. Repeated measures of multiple analyses of variance were used to test mean differences between the values of both groups. A paired t",

The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations have not been fully characterized, therefore a previous analysis of NS5A-SH3 domain interactions was extended. By using a semi-quantitative ELISA assay, a hierarchy of binding between various SH3 domains for NS5A was demonstrated. Molecular modelling of a polyproline motif within NS5A (termed PP2.2) bound to the FynSH3 domain predicted that the specificity-determining RT-loop region within the SH3 domain did not interact directly with the PP2.2 motif. However, it was demonstrated that the RT loop did contribute to the specificity of binding, implicating the involvement of other intermolecular contacts between NS5A and SH3 domains. The modelling analysis also predicted a critical role for a conserved arginine located at the C terminus of the PP2.2 motif; this was confirmed experimentally. Finally, it was demonstrated that, in comparison with wild-type replicon cells",

    "<bos>POV: Henry vs Martin + a poll\n\nI won\u2019t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H & M do resemble me in various ways :)\n\nI usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the",

General benefits of using Hitec Power Protection rotary UPS systems are:\n\nMost reliable systemThe simple design has fewer components than for example static UPS systems. This highly improves the reliability (MTBF). Our systems have a lifetime expectancy of more than 25 years.\n\nMost cost and energy efficient systemOperating efficiency of our systems can exceed 97%, because they do not require power conversion in the power path or a conditioned, energy consuming battery room during operation. You also do not need battery replacement every 3 to 5 years, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to for example static UPS technologies.\n\nMost environmental friendly systemOur rotary systems have high energy efficiency and do not use batteries. Static UPS systems for example produce a considerable amount of chemical waste during its lifetime, because batteries need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years. Click here to find out more about the environmental benefits of our systems.\n\nMost space efficient systemA static UPS system requires a diesel generator set, power electronics, batteries and numerous auxiliary equipment.

    "<bos>Soluble di- and aminopeptidases in Escherichia K-12. Dispensible enzymes.\nAs part of a study of the peptidase content of Escherichia coli K-12, two peptidase-deficient amino acid auxotrophs isolated and characterized by Miller as pepD- (strain CM17) and pepD- pepN- pepA- pepB- pepQ- (strain CM89) were examined for the presence of several peptidases previously obtained from strain K-12 in this laboratory. The soluble fraction of each mutant was found to lack the broad-specificity strain K-12 dipeptidase DP and the strain CM89 fraction also lacked activity characteristic of the strain K-12 aminopeptidases AP, L, and OP; like strain CM17, strain CM89 contained the tripeptide-specific aminopeptidase TP. Strain CM89 (but not CM17) appeared to contain little if any activity attributable to the ribosome-bound aminopeptidase I of strain K-12. Whereas loss of DP, AP, OP, and aminopeptidase I activity may be attributed to the pepD-, pepB-, pepN-, and pepA- mutations, respectively",

Fifty-three patients with head injury were divided into 3 groups; Group A patients with mild head injury; Group B with moderate head injury; and Group C with severe head injury. The serum levels of CD62p, CD63 were measured on 12 h, d 1, 3, 5 and 7 after injury. The serum levels of CD62p and CD63 in Group B and Group C were higher than those in Group A and control (P<0.05). The serum level of CD62p in Group C was higher than that in Group B (P<0.05). The serum levels of CD62p in Group C on d 1, 3, 5 after injury were higher than those on 12 h (P<0.05). The serum level of CD63 in Group B on d 3 after injury were higher than",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nWhere to get flight dynamics for a flight sim model?\n\nOnce, a while ago, I tried to create a Flight Simulator X model for an aircraft that I wanted a model of, but was soon overwhelmed by having to guess so much of the flight dynamics. Is there somewhere where I could get detailed information about the flight dynamics of aircraft without contacting the manufacturer, a pilot, or having the plane itself to run tests on? I mean for things like drag at different mach, drag coefficient created by the landing gear, lift coefficient created by the flaps, detailed stuff about the engines, etc.\n\nA:\n\nUnfortunately I have no experience with how FSX models aircraft, but at a guess, it's model requires extensive experimental data from a real aircraft to truly get the right parameters.\nAnd that's something no hobbyist is likely to be able to do. For that matter, it's pretty difficult for a pilot to do, since actually recording the relevant data is difficult, and some of what you need to know requires doing things with the aircraft you probably shouldn't do in most circumstances.\nX-Plane's flight model and aircraft creation tool is far more forgiving. You still end up having to guess a lot of parameters,",

Sixteen eyes of eight rabbits were subjected to conventional 4-mm recession of superior rectus muscles. Two rabbits were untreated as control. The rabbits were killed and their eyes were enucleated at 3 (group 3), 6 (group 6), 24 (group 24), and 72 (group 72) hours after the operation (two rabbits per group), and the expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, bFGF-2, and TGF-beta1 was immunohistochemically examined. The peak levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, and TGF-beta1 expression were observed in groups 24, 6, and 3, respectively. However, bFGF-2 was less expressed than the other growth factors in all groups.

The upgrades here are where it matters most - a 20 crit increase over t6 (more than 1 % - thats fantastic in a single piece!) and plus 9",
    "<bos>My new global trends book is out now: The Future of Almost Everything. But it takes at least 20 years to evaluate how good a trends analyst was / is \u2013 so what about forecasts made by me in previous books, about what to expect over the following decade or two or three? How did those forecasts measure up? I had to answer that question for myself by re-reading what I wrote in the past about the future, before writing my latest book. Read FREE SAMPLE of The Truth about Almost Everything.\n\nSo you can judge for yourself, here are loads of predictions I made in the past - and the book in which they were made plus date. Every one of these is already a reality or looks like it soon could be, as of August 2015....And yes I got some things wrong - not many fortunately. I am going to publish the entire text of Futurewise 1998 edition on this website for a complete picture - but of course on this site already are hundreds of posts and videos going back in some cases over 20 years.\n\nHere's one I got wrong: I thought video streaming would take off - but with more use of live video using smartphones that we have actually seen.

The drives are configured in RAID 6.  \nYesterday, some kind of unknown \"event\" occurred and the array dropped offline.  We rebooted the server (running CENTOS 6.2) and upon startup, the Array Controller reported that 13 of the drives are \"missing\".  When we look at the volume in the Array management, there are two entries for each slot for slots 1-12.  One shows a 600gb drive and one shows a 0gb drive.  There are no more entries after 12.\nWe contacted HP support, who sent us to Tier 2 support, and after many hours gave up.

She was the daughter of a blacksmith, Gilboe started her career in musical theatre and operas in Aarhus before she moved to Copenhagen to work at different theatres. Her national breakthrough came, when she  accepted the role as Eliza in My Fair Lady at Falkoner Teatret at short notice in 1960. Although she was then in her mid-40s and had only five days to learn the part, the production was a huge success.\n\nIn the following years she took on more and more non-singing roles, and besides her theatre career she took a degree in rhetoric. Later in her life she started teaching rhetoric and drama. She appeared in several films, receiving particular acclaim for her appearance as Esther in Carlo & Esther, a 1994 film. She plays a woman in her 70s who catches the attention of Carlo who has a wife with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "<bos>Update: Sree Narasimha Jayanthi \u2013 May 17th 2019\n\nThis day signifies the appearance of Lord Narasimha on the planet. Lord Narasimha is the fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is believed to have appeared to protect his devotee, Prahlada, from his father Hiranyakashyapu .\n\nIf you listen to the song \u201d Narashima Nembo davana\u201d posted on youtube, there is a paragraph which explains how Lord Narashima came from the pillar. Hiranyakashyapu pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Lord Vishnu was present in it pillar. Prahalada who was a great devotee said yes. Next, you know Hiranyakashyapu uses his Gadha and broke open the pillar and there emerged our Lord Narasimha who than slained Hiranyakashyapu using his sharp paws.\n\nThe day signifies the triumph of good over evil and the eagerness of the lord to protect his devotees from evil.\n\nWhen my Parents visited us last year, my Father recited the \u201cBhagavatha Purana\u201d for three weeks at my place. The way my Dad explained this part of the Purana, brings tears to my eyes",
    "<bos>Enhanced absorption and inhibited metabolism of emodin by 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside: Possible mechanisms for Polygoni Multiflori Radix-induced liver injury.\nPolygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) has been commonly used as a tonic in China for centuries. However, PMR-associated hepatotoxicity is becoming a safety issue. In our previous in vivo study, an interaction between stilbenes and anthraquinones has been discovered and a hypothesis is proposed that the interaction between stilbene glucoside-enriching fraction and emodin may contribute to the side effects of PMR. To further support our previous in vivo results in rats, the present in vitro study was designed to evaluate the effects of 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (TSG) on the cellular absorption and human liver microsome metabolism of emodin. The obtained results indicated that the absorption of emodin in Caco-2 cells was enhanced and the metabolism of emodin in human liver microsomes was inhibited after TSG treatment. The",
    "<bos>Perinatal outcome with the modified biophysical profile.\nOur purpose was to evaluate perinatal outcomes in high-risk pregnancies monitored with a modified biophysical profile. All non-insulin-dependent patients referred for antepartum fetal surveillance received a modified biophysical profile biweekly. A modified biophysical profile is a combination of a nonstress test and an amniotic fluid index. Patients with a singleton gestation and intact membranes were entered into a protocol of randomized backup testing for an abnormal modified biophysical profile. Those patients having a nonreactive fetal heart rate, significant variable decelerations, late decelerations, or an amniotic fluid index < or = 5.0 cm received either a contraction stress test or a biophysical profile immediately. Once randomized, a patient received the same backup test, when indicated, with subsequent testing. A total of 2774 patients had 17,429 tests with an uncorrected perinatal mortality rate of 2.9 per 1000. The overall incidence of an adverse perinatal outcome (i.e., perinatal death or nursery death before infant hospital discharge, cesarean delivery for fetal distress within the first 2 hours of labor, 5-minute Apgar score < 7, neonatal seizures",
    "<bos>Conventional methods for producing metal powder include a water atomizing method, which provides metal powder by injecting a high pressure water jet to a flow of a molten material; a gas atomizing method, which employs spraying of N2 gas or Ar gas in place of the water jet used in the atomizing method; and a centrifugation method, in which a molten material jet is injected into cooling water present in a rotary drum rotating at high speed. Fine particles are also produced through a breakdown method such as mechanical formation employing a mill or the like and also through a buildup method such as a precipitation method or a sol-gel method.\nHowever, in the water atomizing method and the gas atomizing method, the nozzle structure is complicated and an excessive load is imposed on nozzles, resulting in lowered durability of the nozzle, since the molten material is formed into powder form by a flow of high pressure cooling water or cooling gas. Meanwhile, in the centrifugation method, the structure of the apparatus is complicated, in order to enable high-speed rotation of the rotary drum. Furthermore, in these methods, the molten metal is pulverized on the basis of collision energy. Thus, the resulting particle size is varied, and the yield of fine particles is poor. The breakdown method employing mechanical formation or",
    "<bos>It is a truism that modern cell phones feature a multitude of features that expand on the traditional cell phone functionality. For example, today cell phone users are able to use their phones to connect to the Internet, manage meetings, appointments, and other aspects of their every day lives, listen to music and watch videos, etc. In essence the cell phone\u2014which began as a single-function communicator\u2014has grown into a fully functioning multimedia device. However the fundamental function of a cell phone remains communication. It should be noted that cell phones are also sometimes referred to as mobile phones, which in the proper meaning of the word indicates that the user of that phone is mobile, and is supposedly always available for anyone who might want to contact him or her.\nThe core functionality of mobile/cell phones has been basically the same since the first devices were made available to consumers. Although there has been a rapid expansion in the feature set of most cell phones, the core functionality has not seen a similar expansion. The reasons for the development discrepancy likely have to do with the fact that the core functionality is sufficient for most users and that there are not just that many ways of enhancing the person-to-person communication experience on a mobile device\nArguably, the most important enhancement in the",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nHow to create a django User using DRF's ModelSerializer\n\nIn django, creating a User has a different and unique flow from the usual Model instance creation. You need to call create_user() which is a method of BaseUserManager.\nSince django REST framework's flow is to do restore_object() and then save_object(), it's not possible to simply create Users using a ModelSerializer in a generic create API endpoint, without hacking you way through.\nWhat would be a clean way to solve this? or at least get it working using django's built-in piping?\nEdit:\nImportant to note that what's specifically not working is that once you try to authenticate the created user instance using django.contrib.auth.authenticate it fails if the instance was simply created using User.objects.create() and not .create_user().\n\nA:\n\nEventually I've overridden the serializer's restore_object method and made sure that the password being sent is then processes using instance.set_password(password), like so:\ndef restore_object(self, attrs, instance=None):\n    if not instance:\n        instance = super(RegisterationSerializer, self).restore_object",
    "<bos>Eochrysis, a new replacement name for the fossil Protochrysis Bischoff, 1916 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Chrysididae) nec Pascher, 1911 (Protista: Cryptomonada).\nThe genus Protochrysis (type species P. succinalis Bischoff, 1916, by monotypy) was established by Bischoff (1916: 139) for distinctive fossil insect remains of Eocene (Lutetian) age from the former K\u00f6nigsberg outskirts of East Prussia (now Kalinigrad, Russian Federation), referred at present to the Chrysididae (Hymenoptera) (Brues 1933; Carpenter 1985, 1992). However, an identical generic name Protochrysis had previously been proposed by Pascher (1911: 191) for a living protist (Cryptomonada). Bischoff's (1916) name is therefore an invalid junior homonym. Carpenter (1985: 577) proposed a new replacement name for the fossil genus, but overlooked the fact that his newly proposed generic name Protochrysidis was also preoccupied, again",

Ayrton Senna, before the San Marino Grand Prix, during which he suffered a fatal crash.\n\nOne of my best friends has been killed on the curve where I escaped death. I was lucky; he wasn't. It's like having a cheque book. You start pulling out the pages until one day no pages are left. He was the one driver so perfect nobody thought anything could happen to him. Gerhard Berger, Formula 1 driver, on Ayrton Senna.\n\nIt was at the bottom of our hearts to dedicate this victory to our great friend, Ayrton Senna. He was also heading for his fourth title. Claudio Taffarel, Brazil's goalkeeper, following victory in the World Cup final.\n\nThere will never be another Senna. The poet of speed is dead.

    "<bos>Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\n\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018difference\u2019: is women\u2019s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\n\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From \u2018Protection\u2019 to \u2018Equality\u2019 (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to \u2018Provision for \u201cMenstrual Leave\u201d\u2019.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour.

    "<bos>Araucaria clonal forestry: types of cuttings and mother tree sex in field survival and growth\n\nResumo:\n\nAraucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paran\u00e1 pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by",

The mutations described are Gly-12----Arg, Gly-12----Val, Gln-61----His, Gln-61----Leu, which are all oncogenic, and the effector region mutant Asp-38----Glu. The resolutions of the crystal structures range from 2.0 to 2.6 A. Cellular and mutant p21 proteins are almost identical, and the only significant differences are seen in loop L4 and in the vicinity of the gamma-phosphate. For the Gly-12 mutants the larger side chains interfere with GTP binding and/or hydrolysis. Gln-61 in cellular p21 adopts a conformation where it is able to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. This conformation has not been found for the mutants of Gln-61. Furthermore, Leu-61 cannot activate the nucleophilic water because of the chemical nature of its side chain. The D38E mutation preserves its ability to",
    "<bos>1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to particularly an optical coherence tomography apparatus including an interference optical system which is used in the medical field, an optical coherence tomography method, an ophthalmic apparatus, a method of controlling the ophthalmic apparatus, and a storage medium.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nCurrently, various types of ophthalmic apparatuses using optical devices are used. Such apparatuses include, for example, an anterior ocular segment imaging apparatus, a fundus camera, and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Among them all, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) apparatus (to be referred to as an \u201cOCT apparatus\u201d hereinafter) is an apparatus capable of obtaining a high-resolution tomogram of an object to be examined. This OCT apparatus has been becoming an indispensable apparatus for dedicated retinal outpatient clinics.\nFor example, the OCT apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-325849 uses low-coherent light as a light source. Light from the light source is split into measurement light and reference light through a splitting optical path such as a beam splitter. Measurement light is light to irradiate an object to be examined such as the eye through a measurement light path. Return light of",
    "<bos>Moss (Physcomitrella patens) GH3 proteins act in auxin homeostasis.\nAuxins are hormones involved in many cellular, physiological and developmental processes in seed plants and in mosses such as Physcomitrella patens. Control of auxin levels is achieved in higher plants via synthesis of auxin conjugates by members of the GH3 family. The role of the two GH3-like proteins from P. patens for growth and auxin homeostasis was therefore analysed. The in vivo-function of the two P. patens GH3 genes was investigated using single and double knockout mutants. The two P. patens GH3 proteins were also heterologously expressed to determine their enzymatic activity. Both P. patens GH3 enzymes accepted the auxin indole acetic acid (IAA) as substrate, but with different preferences for the amino acid to which it is attached. Cytoplasmic localization was shown for PpGH3-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Targeted knock-out of either gene exhibited an increased sensitivity to auxin, resulting in growth inhibition. On plain mineral media mutants had higher levels of free IAA and less conjugated IAA than the wild type, and this effect was enhanced when auxin was supplied. The DeltaPpGH3-",
    "<bos>This invention relates to a method for applying normally dry relatively large particle size (granular) fertilizers to crops, such as lawns. Lawn fertilizers are available in various forms including solutions of nutrients in water, dispersions (suspensions) of fine powders (70-80 mesh and smaller) in an aqueous medium, dry powders and dry granules. In some cases, the nutrient materials are supported on an inert carrier, e.g. sand or clay.\nBoth liquid fertilizers and dispersions of fine powders in aqueous mediums are usually spray applied using conventional types of liquid solution fertilizer spraying equipment. A typical example of a spray applied dispersion of a powdered fertilizer material is illustrated by the U.S. Pat. No. to Funk 4,036,627.

    "<bos>Prevalence of varicocoele and its association with body mass index among 39,559 rural men in eastern China: a population-based cross-sectional study.\nVaricocoele is a common cause of male infertility. We undertook a population-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of varicocoele among rural men in eastern China and its association with body mass index. A total of 39,559 rural men in six counties in Beijing, Guangdong and Shandong provinces were recruited from 2011 to 2012. The presence and severity of varicocoele were measured by physical examinations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between varicocoele and body mass index after adjusting for possible confounders. Varicocoele was diagnosed in 1911 of 39,559 participants with an overall prevalence of 4.83%. The prevalence of varicocoele was highest in underweight (6.29%) and lowest in obese patients (3.71%, p < 0.05). The prevalence also decreased as body mass index increased in all three varicocoele grades. In multivariate logistic regression analysis",

    "<bos>Q:\n\nIs a low number of members in a class considered a code smell?\n\nI am currently making a simple to-do list program using the MVC pattern, and thus have a model class for the Notebook. However, something feels \"off\" as it has a very low number of members.\nThe Notebook is composed of categories, which are composed of To-do lists, which are composed of Items. \nWhat I cannot place is whether this is a case poor analysis (e.g. there are more members and responsibilities I am just missing them..) or perhaps a code smell that the class is not needed (in that case I'm not sure what to do as I could just have a list of categories in that controller, but then I don't have a notebook entity modelled which seems wrong as well).\nBelow is the very simple class I have:\nclass Notebook\n{\n    private String title;\n    private List<Category> categories;\n\n    public Notebook(String title, List<Category> categories)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public void setCategories(List<Category> categories)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public List<Category> getCategories()\n    {\n    }\n",

    "<bos>Social deprivation and primary hyperparathyroidism.\nTo investigate the potential relationship between social status or deprivation and the prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We retrospectively identified a cohort of patients diagnosed as having PHPT between 1981 and 2007 from the Scottish Morbidity Records database. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2006 quintiles were derived for these patients by using the postal codes. The distribution of the SIMD quintiles was examined to determine the possible influence of deprivation on the incidence of PHPT. In Scotland between 1981 and 2007, 3,039 patients were diagnosed as having PHPT, in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases code for PHPT. The distribution of the PHPT cohort across the SIMD 2006 quintiles was significantly different from that expected, with a higher representation (27.2%) among the most deprived and a lower representation (14.5%) in the least deprived quintile, in comparison with the 20% expected in each quintile (P<.0001). The findings in this study suggest that socioeconomic deprivation is associated with an increased risk of",
    "<bos>1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to multi-chamber process equipments for fabricating semiconductor devices.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nIn recent years, the advance in device miniaturization and IC complexity is increasing the need for more accurate and more complicated processes, and wafers of larger diameters. Accordingly, much attention is focused on multi-chamber process equipments (or systems) in view of increase of complex precesses, and enhancement of throughput in an individual wafer processing system.\nFIG. 14 shows one conventional example. A multi-chamber process equipment of this example includes a wafer transfer chamber 1, a plurality of process chambers 3 connected with the transfer chamber 1 through respective gate valves 2, a load lock chamber (preliminary evacuation chamber) 5 connected with the transfer chamber 1 through a gate valve 4, and a wafer load chamber 7 connected with the load lock chamber 5 through a gate valve 6.\nIn the wafer transfer chamber 1 and the load lock chamber 5, there are provided wafer transfer arms 9 and 10 for carrying a wafer 8, as shown in FIG. 14. The transfer arm 10 is designed to take each wafer ",
    "<bos>In general, absorbent articles should comfortably fit the body of a wearer. Most absorbent articles include an absorbent pad formed by an absorbent core contained in a wrap comprising a barrier tissue and/or a forming tissue. The subject invention discloses an absorbent article generally having extensibility in at least one direction, preferably the cross-direction. Such extensibility permits an absorbent article to extend and expand about the wearer and thus to better conform to the body of the wearer. Such extension and expansion about the wearer is feasible because both the bodyside liner and the outer cover are extensible in at least the one direction.\nIn conventional structures, the outer cover is typically adhesively secured to the forming tissue of the absorbent pad. In such embodiments, extending the outer cover in the cross-direction extends the forming tissue in the cross-direction. The force used to extend the outer cover, and thence the absorbent pad, can tear or otherwise damage the forming tissue or the barrier tissue of the absorbent pad. Since the absorbent pad is typically a sealed enclosure, namely an absorbent core enclosed within the combination of a forming tissue and a barrier tissue, tearing the absorbent pad, namely either the forming tissue or the barrier tissue, can release superabsorbent particles and other absorbent materials, such as cellulose fluff into contact with",

And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\n\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED",

    "<bos>Introduction {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nInfliximab (IFX), a chimeric anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in a considerable proportion of IBD patients refractory to any other treatments \\[[@ref1],[@ref2]\\]. However, 8-12% of adult and/or pediatric patients fail to respond to the induction regimen (known as primary non responders) and approximately 40% of patients who respond initially and achieve clinical remission inevitably lose response over time\\[[@ref3],[@ref7]\\]. Lack of response to IFX is a stable trait and suggests that the differences in response might be in part genetically determined. Considering the high cost and safety profile of this drug, genetic targeting of patients responding to this therapy is certainly of great interest \\[[@ref8]\\]. So far, limited candidate gene association studies with response to IFX have been reported \\[[@ref9]-[@ref11]\\]. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in paediatric IBD patients has revealed that the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci were associated with primary non response \\[[@ref12]\\].

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to the reporting of Power Headroom (PH) from a User Equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system that supports carrier aggregation.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nMobile communication systems were originally designed to provide users with voice communication services while they are on the move. Current mobile communication systems are capable of supporting both voice communication services and data communication services for mobile users.\nStandardization for a next generation of mobile communication technology for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is being conducted for Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is a broadband packet-based communication technology that is expected to provide download speeds that improve upon existing data transmission rates by up to 100 Megabytes/second (Mbps). In attempting to achieve such a high data rate, studies have been conducted that use a minimum number of nodes in connection with a simplified network topology, and that place a radio protocol as close as possible to radio channels.\nFIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an LTE wireless communication system. The LTE wireless communication system includes a plurality of Evolved Node Bs (ENBs) 105, 110, 1",

Let $v$ be any separating vector for $\\mathcal{R}$ and let $w = -Uv$. This $w$ is separating for $\\mathcal{R}$ since any nonzero $T \\in \\mathcal{R}$ that annihilated $w$ would make $-TU$ a nonzero operator in $\\mathcal{R}$ than annihilates $v$.\nBut we can show, using the fact that $UP = P$ and $U",
    "<bos>Methylglyoxal activates NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and induces COX-2 expression via a p38-dependent pathway in synovial cells.\nThere is growing evidence of an increased prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) among people with diabetes. Synovial inflammation and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are two key features of patients with OA. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a common intermediate in the formation of advanced glycation end-products, and its concentration is also typically higher in diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of the treatment of different MGO concentrations to rabbit HIG-82 synovial cells on COX-2 expression. The MGO induced COX-2 mRNA expression was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The MGO induced COX-2 protein production and its signaling pathways were detected by western blotting. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation by MGO was examined by immunofluorescence. In the present study, we find that MGO has no toxic effects on rabbit synovial cells under the experimental conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that MGO induced COX-2 mRNA and protein production. Moreover, MGO induces p38-dependent COX-2 protein expression as well",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nPython Segmentation Fault?\n\nFirst off, I didnt even know a memory error / segfault was possible in python. Kudos to learning something new!\nI have this database I create\ndatabase = DBManager(dbEndpoint,dbUser,dbPass,dbSchema)\n\nAnd then I try to use it in a thread\ndef stateTimeThreadStart():\n     database.getTable('CLIENTS')\n\nthreads = []\nthreads.append(threading.Thread(name='State Updater', target=stateTimeThreadStart, args=()))\nthreads[0].start()\n\nThe output is \nSegmentation fault: 11\n\nWhat on earth is going on here? It definetly has something to do with database.getTable('CLIENTS') because when I comment it out the issue does not occur. In addition, I have also tried to pass the database to the thread with no luck. Any ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA:\n\nSegmentation faults in Python can occur due to database connectors. The drivers used to connect to the database are usually coded in a C base, so in case of RAM overload or perhaps other reasons it throws Segmentation Faults.\nThis is further exacerbated by the fact that you are using multithreading.",

    "<bos>Abstract\n\nThe entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform cortex, and synaptic plasticity in this pathway may affect olfactory processing. In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin. Okadaic acid, which blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also prevented LTD. Activation of protein phosphatases following calcium influx therefore contributes to induction of LTD in layer II of the entorhinal cortex.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe mechanisms that mediate the\ninduction of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) [1, 2] and depression (LTD) [3\u20135]\nhave been studied intensively within the hippocampus, but less",
    "<bos>The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state\u2019s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\n\nHawaii\u2019s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\n\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\n\n\u201cYou want a system that accounts for the fact that somebody may be sleepy or careless, or an interface may",

    "<bos>1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a motor drive apparatus which is, for example, used for driving an X-Y table of a monolithic wire bonder or a die bonder serving as one of IC manufacturing apparatus, and a method of controlling the same.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nThere is known a method of accurately stopping a motor at a target position, as disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 55-77384/1980. In this prior art, after the motor passes through the target position, an error extreme point is obtained in order to determine a current value to be supplied to the motor to correct the error. Then, a rectangular current is supplied to the motor so as to eliminate the error and stop the motor at the target position.\nHereinafter, a background technology of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing one example of a motor drive apparatus controlling a typical three-phase synchronous motor. FIG. 11 is a detailed view showing a motor 1 of FIG. 10. FIG. 12 is a view showing inductive voltages of the motor 1 of FIG. 10",
    "<bos>The present invention relates generally to digital copy protection, digital rights management, and conditional access, and more particularly but not exclusively to enabling transferable entitlements using Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs) for providing content to different network devices.\nToday a consumer can readily purchase an entitlement to content such as a ticket to the opera, a sports event, movie, or the like. Often, the purchased ticket can be redeemed at some later stage and location. Similarly a consumer may purchase an airline ticket and redeem it for an airplane flight. However, there is a difference of transferability between these two ticket transactions. For various reasons, of both pricing and security, airline tickets represent non-transferable entitlements, where only the named recipient of the entitlement may redeem it, whereas movie tickets, or the like, are typically transferable.\nTransferability is an attribute of the entitlement granted by an original owner to the recipient. It means that the recipient may be free to resell or transfer title to the entitlement prior to its redemption. It also typically means that the owner or its distributors agree to honor the redemption of the entitlement from whoever presents the entitlement. Thus, in some situations, a transferable entitlement may become an object of trade.\nHowever, in today's realm of content, such",
    "<bos>I listened to this one, narrated by Justine Eyre. It was about 12 hours long, but it passed by quickly with this fun read. It's not particularly deep or magical and it doesn't call life as we know it into question.\n\nIt's a nice read/listen, light and intriguing for anyone in the mood for a little escape from the disappointments that have been abounding.\n\nFunny enough, the only problems with the book are also reasons why I liked it. Lily Kaiser's journey is a little too convenient throughout the book but that can be just perfect sometimes. It can be exactly what I need to read or listen in order to balance out the pressure of the world.\n\nSo, yes, the book is a little too neat. The story a little too beautiful and coincidental and works a little too well, but I didn't mind it at all. Mostly because it was also written incredibly well. It moves between times, giving insight into Rose Gallway's life that Lily doesn't readily have and let's the reader piece some of it together on our own. I do enjoy that. And then the author lays it all out and it's just perfect. A little too perfect, like in",
    "<bos>Examination of factors affecting gait properties in healthy older adults: focusing on knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain.\nGait properties change with age because of a decrease in lower limb strength and visual acuity or knee joint disorders. Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76.1 (5.7) years). Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and knee joint pain were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Among older adults without vision problems and knee joint pain that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had significantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P < .05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with pain in both knees showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. A decrease of knee extension strength and",
    "<bos>The Effects of Event Rate on a Cognitive Vigilance Task.\nThe present experiment sought to examine the effects of event rate on a cognitive vigilance task. Vigilance, or the ability to sustain attention, is an integral component of human factors research. Vigilance task difficulty has previously been manipulated through increasing event rate. However, most research in this paradigm has utilized a sensory-based task, whereas little work has focused on these effects in relation to a cognitive-based task. In sum, 84 participants completed a cognitive vigilance task that contained either 24 events per minute (low event rate condition) or 40 events per minute (high event rate condition). Performance was measured through the proportion of hits, false alarms, mean response time, and signal detection analyses (i.e., sensitivity and response bias). Additionally, measures of perceived workload and stress were collected. The results indicated that event rate significantly affected performance, such that participants who completed the low event rate task achieved significantly better performance in terms of correction detections and false alarms. Furthermore, the cognitive vigil utilized in the present study produced performance decrements comparable to traditional sensory vigilance tasks. Event rate affects cognitive vigilance tasks in a similar manner as traditional sensory vigilance tasks, such that a direct relation between performance and level of",
    "<bos>(a) Field\nEmbodiments of the present system and method relate to a stereoscopic image display device, and more particularly, to a stereoscopic image display device with an enhanced display quality.\n(b) Description of the Related Art\nIn general, a display device that can display a three-dimensional (3D) image expresses a 3D effect of objects by using binocular parallax. That is, different 2D images are displayed to the left eye and the right eye of a user viewing the display. When the image displayed to the left eye (hereafter referred to as \u201cleft-eye image\u201d) and the image displayed to the right eye (hereafter referred to as \u201cright-eye image\u201d) are processed by the user's brain, the brain recognizes the combination of the left-eye image and the right-eye image as a three-dimensional image having depth perception.\nA display device capable of displaying 3D images using binocular parallax is generally referred to as a stereoscopic 3D image display device. Some stereoscopic 3D image display devices may require the user to wear special headgear or eye glasses (e.g., shutter glasses and polarized glasses). Other stereoscopic 3D image display devices, referred to",

Unity is huge to God. It's huge in churches, from the leadership all the way to the last attender and even more it's huge in terms of the Church with a big 'C'... the collective Christ-followers and the churches in which they worship throughout our nation and world. The verses in God's Word that discuss the importance of unity are prolific and the urgency with which the concept is discussed is palpable.\n\nAll that said, I wanted to write a worship song that, at it's core, could help unify the congregation singing it. I used 'we' language on this one--something I haven't used a ton in the past--because the lyric and theme begged for it, and I searched for words that could articulate the depth of unity that I believe God desires from us. I think the lyric I'm most proud of in this particular song kicks off the second verse:\n\nAll of our brothers and sisters through time have sung of the blood of the same sacrifice",
    "<bos>Longitudinal impedance variability in patients with chronically implanted DBS devices.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy for advanced movement disorders, but its optimal use is still controversial. One factor that could play a role in the proper delivery of therapeutic stimulation by current DBS devices is the variability of the impedance at the interface between the electrode surface and surrounding tissue. To analyze variability and trends in the impedance of chronically-implanted DBS electrodes in subjects with movement disorders. We reviewed impedance values from medical records of DBS patients at an academic tertiary-care movement disorders center. The standard deviation of data recorded within individual subjects and single contacts were used as measures of longitudinal impedance variability. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) determined if a number of effects had significant influences on impedance. We analyzed 2863 impedance measurements from 94 subjects. Median variability, for subjects with follow-up from 6 months to 5 years (n = 77), was 194 \u03a9 for individual subjects and 141 \u03a9 for individual contacts, with a range spanning from 18 to over 600 \u03a9. The GLMM, incorporating all subjects (n = 94), identified time, electrical activity, implanted target, contact position on the",

Removable partial denture (RPD) is commonly used because of its availability. RPDs from flexible resins unlike those from acrylic engage hard and soft tissue undercuts and feel more comfortable in the mouth. The aim of the study was to compare satisfaction with dentures made from these two types of materials. It was a quasi-experimental study among thirty patients at the Prosthetics Clinic, University College Hospital, Ibadan. Patients aged 16 years or more, requiring RPDs with one to three missing teeth in the anterior region of either the upper or lower arch participated. A modified semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographics and oral health variables. The level of satisfaction was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Data were analysed using descriptive and multivariate statistics at a significance level of P < 0.05. The participants' ages ranged between 16 and 51 years, mean age was 33.8 \u00b1 10.01 years. Male: female ratio was 1:1 and mean duration of edentulousness was 11.37 \u00b1",
    "<bos>Q:\n\nSend user to edit page without inserting the record\n\nI currently have an Apex class that pulls the data from a record of one custom object 'property__c' and uses it to create a record of another object 'proposal__c' and then redirects the user to this new record's edit view.\nHowever, there's a problem with this. On the edit page, if the user hits \"cancel,\" the record is still inserted. This is because in order to direct the user to the edit view of the new record, we have to first insert that record so that we can pull its id.\nOutside of making a custom edit view for this object, is it possible to send the user to the edit view without inserting the record first? This would ideally behave the same as if the user simply hit the \"new\" button and then \"cancel.\" The only difference is, we want some of the fields of the record to be pre-populated.\nHere is the code.

    "<bos>Neighbors (novel)\n\nNeighbors is a 1980 novel by American author Thomas Berger. It is a satire of manners and suburbia, and a comment on emotional alienation with echoes of the works of Franz Kafka. Earl Keese\u2019s character and situation begin realistically but become increasingly fantastic. Keese is an Everyman whose life is swiftly turned upside down. As he scrambles to reclaim his sense of normalcy and dignity, he comes to think that everyone, including his family, is against him.\n\nPlot summary \n\nEarl Keese is a middle-aged, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and teenage daughter, Elaine. Earl is content with his dull, unexceptional life, but this changes when a younger, less sophisticated couple, Harry and Ramona, move in next door. Harry is physically intimidating and vulgar; Ramona is sexually aggressive, and both impose themselves on the Keese household. Their free-spirited personalities and overbearing and boorish behavior endear them to Enid and Elaine, but Earl fears that he is losing control of his life and his family. Over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare.\n\nAnalysis \nBerger's off-kilter",

    "<bos>Free peritoneal tumour cells are an independent prognostic factor in curatively resected stage IB gastric carcinoma.\nSeveral studies have shown that the cytological detection of free peritoneal tumour cells (FPTCs) in patients with gastric cancer indicates the presence of metastatic disease. The immunocytochemical detection of FPTCs, especially in early-stage tumours, has not been examined comprehensively. Peritoneal lavage was performed in 351 patients before curative resection of a gastric carcinoma between 1987 and 2001, and an adequate sample was obtained from 346 patients. FPTCs were detected immunocytochemically using Ber-EP4 antibody. Median follow-up time was 70 months. FPTCs were detected in the lavage fluid of 74 patients (21.4 per cent) and correlated with increasing pathological tumour depth (pT) and lymph node (pN) status (P < 0.001). The 5-year overall survival of patients with FPTCs was significantly worse than that of patients without FPTCs (35 versus 71.9 per cent; P < 0.001). FPTCs were present in 14 (8.5 per cent",
    "<bos>The long term objective is to characterize key functionalities of the epithelial cells of the larval mosquito gut as these cellular functions influence and regulate the anionic basis of alkalinization of the gut lumen. A detailed understanding of how gut epithelial cells produce the remarkable and biologically unique pH extremes (i.e. > 10.5) that drive the digestive process will provide new avenues for the development of environmentally safe and specific larvacides. Two specific gene families have been targeted as they have central roles in anion production and transport in the gut alkalinization process: carbonic anhydrases and transmembrane anion transporters. This project will produce molecular and physiological characterizations of members of these two gene families. Their distributions in the tissue and specific roles in larval mosquito gut alkalinization will be defined. Specific cellular phenotypes throughout the gut will be defined and the role of each in the alkalinization process assessed. AIM 1 will examine the expression of multiple carbonic anhydrases. AIM 2 will define and characterize members of the anion transporter gene family. AIM 3 will define the cellular distributions of carbonic anhydrases and anion transporters in the gut and as functions of larval development. AIM 4 will produce a global analysis of gene expression in the specific functional domains of the larval mosquito gut identifying key functionalities",

    "<bos>The Doom Generation (1995)\n\nOctober 25, 1995\n\nFILM REVIEW;Gory Kitsch in a Parody of Teen-Age Road Movies\n\nBy JANET MASLIN\n\nPublished: October 25, 1995\n\nProduction notes for Gregg Araki's \"Doom Generation\" say it is \"Araki's first big-budget feature and marks the end of his film adolescence.\" Well, not exactly. After a promising debut with \"The Living End\" followed by the angrier, more marginalized \"Totally F***ed Up,\" Mr. Araki is still sounding a note of self-congratulatory teen-age rebellion in a film gruesome and obvious enough to make \"Natural Born Killers\" look like a model of restraint.\n\nIt's not even much of a change to find \"The Doom Generation\" billed as \"a heterosexual movie,\" since it shares the effective homoerotic energy of his earlier work. That this film includes a teen-age girl, Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), as part of its sexual menage only means one especially clear target of contempt (\"Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot\" is one of the more printable things anyone says to her)",

Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs it encompasses  and began interments in 1988. It is now one of the busiest cemeteries in the United States.\n\nHistory\nFlorida National Cemetery is located in the Withlacoochee State Forest, approximately  north of Tampa. The forest was acquired by the federal government from private landowners between 1936 and 1939 under the provisions of the U.S. Land Resettlement Administration. The United States Forest Service managed the property until a lease-purchase agreement transferred it to the Florida Board of Forestry in 1958. Currently, Withlacoochee State Forest is the second-largest state forest in Florida, divided into eight distinct tracts of land.\n\nIn 1842, Congress encouraged settlement here by establishing the Armed Occupation Act. The law granted a patent for  to any man who kept a gun and ammunition, built a house, cultivated  of the land and remained there for at least five years. Settlers moved in to take advantage of the generous offer. The area contained abundant timber and suitable farmland,",
    "<bos>Ask HN: How to approach two competing job offers - is bidding war an option? - mbord\n\nI studied Computer Science, and I recently graduated as a bachelor. I went on to apply to two major Silicon Valley companies, let's call them A and B, and aced the interviews.<p>I got an offer from A, which I would have happily accepted had I not had another company still contemplating their offer. Now B contacted me, not yet ready to give an offer, but they mentioned that their offer would likely be significantly larger if they would be able to see the offer from A in writing.<p>I got my offer from A both verbally and in informal writing to my e-mail. I find it clear that if I asked them for the offer in writing now, they would certainly know what's happening (given that I've kept them waiting for some time now). I told this to B already previously, they understood, but it would certainly benefit me if I had it in writing now.<p>How should this game be played in your opinion? I actually prefer A, and if B's offer were roughly the same size, I would be very happy to take A. However, I am wondering whether I am a",
    "<bos>Milestones to recovery: preliminary validation of a framework to promote recovery and map progress through the medium secure inpatient pathway.\nForensic mental health care in the UK has undergone a rapid expansion since the late 1990s. In medium secure units (MSUs), there is growing emphasis on developing care pathways without much theoretical underpinning. We developed a concept of 'Milestones to Recovery' (MTR) to measure progress through the MSU pathway. Our aim was to validate the MTR framework. Our hypotheses were that patients scoring higher on the MTR Scale would be more likely to be aggressive to others in the following 6 months and resident in the acute areas of the unit and that those scoring lower would be more likely to be discharged within 6 months of the assessment. An MTR scale was developed to enable the investigation of the validity of the MTR framework and evaluated with staff evaluations of 80 resident patients using a prospective, longitudinal and naturalistic design. The results suggest that the MTR framework is valid in discriminating between different stages on the MSU pathway. Therapeutic engagement was particularly important in terms of progress through the MSU, whereas current behaviour was important in predicting future aggression. Further research is required to test the MTR framework across different levels of security, with",
    "<bos>Rigid stretchers for transporting injured patients are well known. Certain known rigid stretchers are partially collapsible. These stretchers include one or more rigid support panels or beams. Because of the rigid panels or beams, these stretchers can be relatively heavy and cumbersome when handled by emergency personnel during rescue operations, and these stretchers can occupy a relatively significant amount of space in vehicles and other storage areas. Also, these known stretchers do not include a patient covering which aids in the protection of emergency personnel from hazardous body fluids from the patient and which guards the front of patient's body during transport.\nOne known rescue bag has been developed for keeping injured people warm while they are lying on stretchers. Though this rescue bag covers part of the patient's body, it is merely an accessory to a stretcher. Accordingly, one of the disadvantages of this rescue bag is that it does not function as a patient carrier. The emergency personnel must use a stretcher in conjunction with this rescue bag in order to pick-up, carry and transport an injured person to a desired location. In addition, such a rescue bag does not have medical treatment openings which provide emergency personnel with relatively quick access to select portions of the person's body, for example, to deliver essential treatments, such as IV",

    "<bos>Holiday Punch \u2014 Plus a Cozy Fire\n\nCharles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.\n\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\n\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\n\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to",

    "<bos>Genetic diversity studies of Brazilian garlic cultivars and quality control of garlic-clover production.\nThe garlic cultivars grown in Brazil evolved from somatic mutations and clone selection by breeding programs and by the introduction of germplasm from other countries. Morphological characters have been used to differentiate these cultivars. Two hundred and six random amplified polymorphic DNA markers were utilized for a diversity analysis of the 17 most planted garlic cultivars in Brazil. Bootstrap analysis showed that the number of markers was efficient and sufficient to obtain a coefficient of variation of 10%. Similarity varied between 16 and 98% and cluster analysis showed that, in general, genetic similarities correlate with morphological characters of the cultivars and production cycle variation. High bootstrap values at most of the nodes supported the dendrogram stability. The grouping of most varieties agreed well with previous reports based on morphological characters. As a vegetative-propagated species, viral diseases are a key problem regarding production and quality of the bulbs, causing gradual loss of yield and decrease in storage capacity. To improve the health quality of garlic seed, a virus-free stock of garlic cloves of the Amarante cultivar was obtained. The ability to distinguish garlic cultivars to detect varietal mixing after in vitro multiplication is extremely important, since correct identification is not possible until bulbs are",
    "<bos>I admit I never thought I\u2019d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game\u2019s strengths. But it\u2019s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren\u2019t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don\u2019t match up very well. I\u2019d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis\u2019s famous death in castle. I\u2019ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.\n\nYou may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player\u2019s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I\u2019ll do so now. A player\u2019s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums\u2014it\u2019s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player\u2019s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to",

    "<bos>The present invention relates generally to improved means and methods for processing documents using electronic imaging, and more particularly, to the use of electronic imaging for processing financial documents, such as checks and related documents in a banking environment.\nToday's financial services industry is facing the immense challenge of processing huge amounts of documents efficiently. Predictions that document payment methods would decline have not been realized. In fact, document payment methods have grown worldwide and are expected to continue increasing. There is thus a vital need to devise improved means and methods for processing such documents.\nThe use of imaging technology as an aid to document processing has been recognized as one way of significantly improving document processing, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,205,780, 4,264,808, and 4,672,186. Generally, imaging involves optically scanning documents to produce electronic images that are processed electronically and stored on high capacity storage media (such as magnetic disc drives and/or optical memory) for later retrieval and display. It is apparent that document imaging provides the opportunity to reduce document handling and movement, since these electronic images can be used in place of the actual documents.\nHowever, despite",
    "<bos>PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE): Rationale and trial design.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the US, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of these deaths. While efforts aimed at treating CAD in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. CAD is commonly treated using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this treatment has increased exponentially since its adoption over three decades ago. Recent questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in CAD is exercise therapy; exercise programs have been shown to have numerous physiological benefits, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated reductions in mortality. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise, the current study is termed \"PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise\" (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is to determine whether patients randomized to exercise and lifestyle intervention have greater improvement in coronary function",

    "<bos>Mai-Mai\n\nThe term Mayi-Mayi or Mai-Mai refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry.\n\nGroups that fall under the umbrella term \"Mai-Mai\" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.\n\nMai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the \"Kivus\"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy\u2013Goma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War",
    "<bos>Dorsomedial hypothalamic lesions alter intake of an imbalanced amino acid diet in rats.\nWithin 3 h of ingesting an imbalanced amino acid diet (IAAD), rats show attenuated intake. The associated conditioned taste aversion can be ameliorated by giving the serotonin3 receptor blocker, tropisetron (TROP). A recent c-fos study indicated that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) may be activated 2-3 h after ingestion of IAAD. In Experiment 1, DMN-lesioned rats (DMNL) or sham-operated (SHAM) rats were injected with saline (SAL) or TROP just before introduction of IAAD. By 3 h, SAL-DMNL rats consumed more (P < 0.01) of the IAAD than did the SAL-SHAM rats. Thereafter, over the next 21 h, the intake of the SAL-DMNL group returned to control levels. TROP treatment enhanced the intake of the treated groups; the TROP and the lesion effect were additive (P < 0.01). By d 4 of receiving the IAAD, the DMNL groups were eating less than SHAM rats (P < 0.0",
    "<bos>Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\n\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\n\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement",

    "<bos>Four-ever? Competition remedies in the audit market\n\nOxera\n\nIn light of recent accounting scandals, there are widespread calls for the UK competition authority to re-examine the audit market. Yet spending a substantial amount of resources on a market investigation, and concluding once again that there is a competition problem, is of little value if a suitable remedy cannot be found. A break-up of the Big Four is perceived by many as a necessary and long-awaited intervention, but is it the right solution? And if not, what would be an alternative remedy?\n\nThe UK audit market has gone through some turmoil recently.[1] This month the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which regulates UK audit, announced a deterioration in audit quality across the \u2018Big Four\u2019 firms (KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY) compared with the previous year. Most notably, the FRC noted that 50% of KPMG\u2019s FTSE 350 audits failed to reach the FRC\u2019s standard for audit quality.[2] At a global level, the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators found significant problems in 40% of the 918 audits of listed public interest entities that it inspected last year.[3]\n\nThe recent audit failures uncovered by regulators",
    "<bos>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII?? is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1. In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies",

    "<bos>How Idris Elba's 'Luther' Puts Us in the Mindset of a Renegade Detective\n\n\"Luther\" is a series about righteous indignation. Yes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals.\n\nYes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody version of London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals. But the satisfaction of seeing those cases solved, those murderers and kidnappers caught, is muted, secondary to the suffering and sacrifice and validation of protagonist John Luther, the detective played by Idris Elba with a staggering display of movie star charisma that seems like it ought to produce static shocks with everything with which he comes into contact. Luther's devoted to his job with an obsessiveness that's destroying him, that, as the series began in 2010, had ended his marriage and eaten him up inside, changing him. He's good at what he does, if prone to extremes, and yet he seems to be perpetually doubted, maligned and hurt because of it.\n\nIn season one",
    "<bos>Ability of MR cholangiography to reveal stent position and luminal diameter in patients with biliary endoprostheses: in vitro measurements and in vivo results in 30 patients.\nOur goal was to evaluate the ability of MR cholangiography to show stent position and luminal diameter in patients with biliary endoprostheses. Susceptibility artifacts were evaluated in vitro in three different stent systems (cobalt alloy-based, nitinol-based, and polyethylene) using two breath-hold sequences (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement, half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo) on a 1.5-T MR imaging system. The size of the stent-related artifact was measured, and the relative stent lumen was calculated. In vivo stent position and patency were determined in 30 patients (10 cobalt alloy-based stents, five nitinol-based stents, and 15 polyethylene stents). In vitro, the susceptibility artifact of the cobalt stent caused complete obliteration of the stent lumen. The relative stent lumens of the nitinol-based and polyethylene stents were 38-50% and 67-100%, respectively. In vivo, all stents were patent at the time of imaging. The",

    "<bos>Major League Baseball All-Century Team\n\nIn 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.\n\nThe top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:\u2014Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).\n\nThe nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.\n\nFor the complete list of the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team.\n\nSelected players",

Below: This SOHO image shows a large filament eruption that occurred February 26.

Astronomers\ntell terrestrial dwellers not to sweat it too much, despite\nthe fact that solar activity is approaching an 11-year peak.\n\nTwo large sunspots moving across the surface of the sun are\nexpected to directly face the Earth soon for up to several\ndays, according to solar scientists.

    "<bos>The case of the vanished sword\n\nBy\nwashingtonpost.com editors\n\nBy John Lockwood\nWashington\n\nOne of our memorials is missing a sword.\n\nThe General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\n\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\n\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a"
