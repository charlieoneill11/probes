Michael Chen, a 32-year-old software developer, schedules a meeting with his team lead to discuss ongoing challenges with the company's flagship application. He's been experiencing intermittent system crashes and performance issues for approximately two months. The crashes occur 2-3 times per week, typically during peak usage hours, and manifest as sudden freezes followed by application termination. The application becomes noticeably slower when handling large datasets, particularly in the analytics module. Michael has confirmed there are no memory leaks, database connection problems, or compatibility issues with the operating system. The performance degradation persists despite adequate server resources and optimized code in recent updates. His development history includes a major refactoring project (completed three months ago), currently running version 3.5.2, though user complaints continue despite the latest patch. He has no known conflicts with third-party libraries, no history of security breaches, and a solid track record of stable releases. The project has a history of scalability challenges (previous lead developer) and legacy code issues (original architect), increasing the technical debt. Workplace factors include a distributed team across time zones, regular code reviews (1-2 per week), adherence to agile methodology, and a complex microservice architecture, with a test coverage of 78.3% (below target). Code review feedback has been positive, with both frontend and backend implementations meeting standards.

Technical analysis reveals several concerns: response time averaging 230ms (exceeding target), CPU utilization at 76% during peak loads (elevated), memory usage at 4.2GB (acceptable), and database query times averaging 180ms (slightly elevated). Server monitoring shows normal operations, and the logging system captures 5.6GB of data daily (near capacity limits). Given the elevated response times, high CPU usage, and increasing log volume, the team has not previously implemented horizontal scaling but should deploy three additional application servers, in line with company infrastructure guidelines. Potential obstacles to scaling, including licensing restrictions, network configuration limitations, container orchestration complexity, load balancer capacity, database connection pooling, caching strategy weaknesses, and insufficient monitoring tools, should be evaluated before implementation.

Recommendation:
The response time of 230ms exceeds our target of 150ms. The CPU utilization of 76% is concerning as it approaches our 80% threshold. The logging volume of 5.6GB daily is nearly at capacity. This application has performance bottlenecks. The system requires horizontal scaling. For our infrastructure, Kubernetes is the preferred orchestration tool. The application has never been horizontally scaled before. We should therefore implement three additional application servers with proper load balancing.
